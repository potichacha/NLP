Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.

We understand you're experiencing issues with integrating Mercury language functions and accessing your cloud database due to potential IAM authentication problems. We're here to help!

To assist you better, could you please provide us with the following information?

* The specific Mercury script you're using.
* The IAM role and permissions you've assigned to the script or the entity running the script.
* Any error messages or logs you're encountering.

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
