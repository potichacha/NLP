We are experiencing a critical issue where our API monitoring dashboard is showing our main API as down, however, we are not experiencing any actual downtime.  Our customers are NOT impacted, but this false positive is causing us significant concern and alarm. We need this addressed ASAP as we rely heavily on your monitoring platform for accurate status reporting.
