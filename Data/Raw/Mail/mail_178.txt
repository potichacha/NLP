Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing frequent timeouts with the API monitoring service for the past few hours.  Our API endpoint for [redacted] is intermittently failing, and the monitoring dashboard isn't providing consistent data.  

This is impacting our live production environment, and we need this resolved ASAP. Please advise on next steps.

Thanks,
John Doe
