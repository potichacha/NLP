Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We understand you are experiencing performance issues during peak hours and would be happy to assist with optimizing your cloud resources.

To better understand your needs, could you please provide us with the following information:

* What specific performance metrics are you seeing degrade (e.g., latency, error rates)?
* What type of instances are you currently using?
* Have you configured any autoscaling policies?

Once we have a clearer picture of your current setup, we can provide more tailored recommendations.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
