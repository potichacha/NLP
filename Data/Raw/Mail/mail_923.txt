Hi John,

We've identified the issue. There was a misconfiguration on our end regarding the 'API_Developer' role permissions. We have corrected this, and your developers should now have the correct access. 

We apologize for the inconvenience. Please let us know if you encounter any further issues. 

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
