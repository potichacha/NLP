Hi Support Team,

Thanks for getting back to me. I've gathered the information you requested:

* Mercury Language version: 1.2.5
* IAM Service version: 2.1.0

Here's the code snippet:

```mercury
endpoint /protected-resource {
  accessControl: requireRole('admin'); // This doesn't seem to be working

  // Rest of the endpoint logic...
}
```

I've also attached screenshots of the API monitoring dashboard inconsistencies. As you can see, some requests to '/protected-resource' show up, while others don't.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,
John
