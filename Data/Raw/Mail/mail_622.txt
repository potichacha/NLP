Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing critical issues with our cloud infrastructure managed by your services.

1. **Cloud Instance Unreachable:** One of our key cloud instances (instance ID: i-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8) has become unreachable. We are unable to SSH or ping the instance. This is causing a major outage for our services.

2. **IAM Role Errors:**  We are also seeing errors related to IAM roles. Our applications are unable to assume the necessary roles, resulting in permission denied errors. 

3. **API Monitoring Delays:**  We are experiencing significant delays in our API monitoring dashboards. The data is not updating in real-time, making it difficult to troubleshoot the other issues.

We need immediate assistance to resolve these problems. Our business operations are severely impacted.

Please acknowledge receipt of this urgent request and provide an update as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
John Doe
