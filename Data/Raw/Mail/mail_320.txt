Aetheros Support,

Here is the information you requested:

* **IAM roles updated:** We updated the 'Data Analyst' role to restrict access to certain API endpoints.
* **Error messages:** We are getting a '403 Forbidden' error with the message 'Invalid API credentials' on all API calls made by users with the 'Data Analyst' role.
* **Time issue began:** Approximately 18:00 UTC yesterday.

This is bringing our operations to a standstill. We need a resolution to this issue very quickly. 

Thanks,
John Doe
