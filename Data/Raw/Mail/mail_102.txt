Hi Aetheros Support,

We're evaluating your API development and IAM services for our new project. One key requirement we have is to implement custom rate limiting based on specific IAM roles within our organization. 

Essentially, we want different user groups to have varying API call limits. Can your platform accommodate this level of granular control over API access?

Thanks,
John Doe
