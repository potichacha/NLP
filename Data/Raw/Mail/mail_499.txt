Dear John,

Thank you for providing the additional information. We have identified the issue. There was a recent update to our IAM service that caused a temporary inconsistency in permission propagation for specific roles, including 'Mercury Developer'. 

We have rectified the issue on our end. Could you please ask your developers to try again? They should now be able to compile their code successfully.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support
