Hi,

Here's the information you requested:

* Role: `DevOpsEngineerRole`
* Username: `jane.smith`
* Error Message: `Access Denied: User is not authorized to perform: iam:CreateRole`

This is strange because the `DevOpsEngineerRole` already exists, and I should be able to assign it without needing to create it.

Please let me know what could be causing this.

Thanks,
John
