Hi Support Team,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I've gathered some more information about the latency spikes:

* Time frame:  Mostly between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM UTC over the past three days.
* API endpoint:  Primarily affecting calls to /api/v1/products.
* Duration/Frequency:  The spikes last anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes and occur every hour or two.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,
John
