Hi Aetheros Support Team,

Our production environment is currently experiencing a critical issue. We're seeing a massive spike in traffic, and our instance scaling, which is configured through your Cloud Management platform, is not triggering.

This is causing significant downtime and impacting our customers. We need this resolved ASAP.

Please advise on the next steps and estimated resolution time.

Regards,
John Doe
