Hi Aetheros Support,

I've been noticing some unusual latency spikes on our API monitoring dashboard for the past few hours. The spikes seem to be intermittent and don't seem tied to any particular endpoint or time of day.

Could you please take a look and see if there's anything going on on your end?

Thanks,
John Doe
