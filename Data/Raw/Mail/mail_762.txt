Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some difficulties scaling our cloud resources effectively through your platform.  Specifically, we're seeing:

* Slow response times during peak hours
* Difficulty adjusting resource allocation on demand

Could you please advise on how we can troubleshoot this? We're using the standard configuration provided during onboarding.

Thanks,
John Doe
