Hello Isiah,

We have reviewed your configuration and traffic details. While we investigate further, a few recommendations:

* **Instance Optimization:** Consider testing C5 instances for better performance with your traffic. Their enhanced CPU capabilities might address the bottlenecks.
* **Database Scaling:** Given your data plan, monitor database performance closely. You might benefit from scaling your database plan or optimizing your queries.
* **Connection Pooling:** Ensure efficient connection pooling within your Mercury application to reuse database connections and reduce overhead during scaling. 

We are also looking into potential interactions between Mercury and the API during scaling events. We will keep you updated on our findings.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
