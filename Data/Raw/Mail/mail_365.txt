Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We've recently started using your API development services alongside your cloud management platform to deploy a new version of our application.

We've successfully deployed everything, and for the most part, it's functioning as expected. However, we're encountering intermittent 502 errors on one particular API endpoint. 

The endpoint in question is: `/api/v2/products`

We've checked our logs and haven't been able to pinpoint the cause of these errors. Could you please help us investigate this further?

Thanks,
Isabella Wagner
