Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm trying to integrate Mercury Language into our existing web application, but I'm encountering a persistent error. I've followed the documentation closely, but I can't seem to resolve it. 

The error message I'm getting is: "Mercury Runtime Error: Invalid object reference." 

Could you please provide some assistance with this issue? I'm available for a call if needed.

Thanks,
John Doe
