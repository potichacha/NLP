Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement to your IAM service. It would be incredibly helpful if your platform supported role inheritance. For example, we'd like to have a 'developer' role inherit permissions from a more basic 'viewer' role. This would simplify our role management significantly.

Let me know your thoughts on this and if this is something you might consider implementing in the future.

Thanks,
John Doe
