We are experiencing a critical issue where our production environment has become inaccessible after a recent change to an IAM role. We believe this may be related to Aetheros Cloud Management as the role was modified through your platform.

We have verified that the role change was successful, but it seems to have broken access to some critical resources. Our team is currently locked out and unable to troubleshoot further.

This is causing a major disruption to our services, and we need immediate assistance to restore access to our environment. Please advise on the next steps and estimated time to resolution.
