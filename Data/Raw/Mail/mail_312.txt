Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand the urgency of the situation and are committed to helping you resolve the API latency issues. 

To assist us in our investigation, could you please provide the following information:

* Your Aetheros Account ID
* The specific API endpoint(s) experiencing latency
* Screenshots of the latency spikes from your API monitoring dashboard

Once we have this information, we'll be able to investigate further and provide a solution. 

Best Regards,
Aetheros Support Team
