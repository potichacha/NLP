Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We're facing urgent scaling issues with our cloud infrastructure for Project Nightingale. We need to increase our capacity significantly within the next 48 hours to accommodate a surge in user traffic. Could you please advise on the quickest and most efficient way to achieve this?

Also, we're having trouble finding comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints related to user authentication. Specifically, we need clarity on the expected request and response formats for token refresh. Could you please direct us to the relevant documentation or provide assistance?

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Isiah Schmeler
