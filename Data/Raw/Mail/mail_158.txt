Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been utilizing your IAM service for a few months now and are very happy with its features and performance. However, we believe adding role inheritance functionality could greatly simplify our user management.

Specifically, it would be beneficial to have roles inherit permissions from parent roles. For instance, a "Senior Developer" role could inherit all permissions from a "Developer" role, with the ability to add specific permissions as needed.

This would reduce redundancy in our permission setup and make it easier to manage users as our team grows.

Could you please consider implementing this feature in a future release?

Thanks,
Isiah Rippin
