Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement for your Cloud Management service. While I appreciate the existing scaling capabilities, I believe there's room for optimization in resource allocation efficiency during peak loads. 

Currently, we've observed that the automatic scaling sometimes provisions more resources than necessary, leading to increased costs. It would be beneficial if the scaling logic could be refined to analyze usage patterns more intelligently and allocate resources more conservatively while still ensuring optimal performance.

Perhaps you could consider implementing algorithms that factor in historical usage data and predict future needs with higher accuracy. Additionally, providing users with more granular control over scaling thresholds and triggers would be valuable.

Thank you for considering this suggestion. I believe it could significantly enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Cloud Management service for many users.

Sincerely,
Isiah McDermott
