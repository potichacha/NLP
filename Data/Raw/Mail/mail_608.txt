Hi Aetheros Support,

We're facing a critical issue with our API integration using the Mercury language. The documentation seems outdated, and we're encountering errors we can't debug. 

Furthermore, our API monitoring dashboard shows inconsistent data compared to what we're experiencing in real-time. This discrepancy is causing major issues in understanding our API performance.

Could you please provide urgent assistance?

Thanks,
Kenneth
