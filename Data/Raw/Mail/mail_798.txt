Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* The latency spikes occurred intermittently over the past 24 hours, with the most recent one happening around 10:00 AM UTC today.
* It seems like all API endpoints are experiencing these spikes, not just specific ones.
* I've attached screenshots from the monitoring dashboard during the most recent spike.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

Thanks,
John Doe
