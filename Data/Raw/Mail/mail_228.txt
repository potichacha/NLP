Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having two separate issues:

1. **Mercury Language Documentation:** I'm struggling to find comprehensive documentation for the Mercury language. Specifically, I need more detailed examples and explanations of error handling and asynchronous programming concepts.

2. **API Rate Limiting:** We're building an API using your platform and need clarity on the rate limits. Could you please provide information about the default rate limits, how to monitor our usage, and the process for requesting a rate limit increase?

Thanks,
John Doe
