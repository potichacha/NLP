Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble getting role-based permissions to work correctly within a Mercury language script. I've defined roles and assigned users to them in your IAM service, but the script doesn't seem to be respecting those permissions when making API calls.

Could you please provide some guidance or documentation on how to properly integrate IAM roles with Mercury scripts?

Thanks,
John Doe
