Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble setting up specific user roles within the IAM service. I want to give certain team members read-only access to a specific API, but I can't seem to find the correct combination of permissions to make that happen.

Could you please advise on how to achieve this?

Thanks,
John Doe
