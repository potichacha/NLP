Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand the urgency of the situation and are here to assist you.

To help us investigate further, could you please provide the following information:

* **Cloud Resources Scaling:**
    * What specific cloud resources are you concerned about (e.g., virtual machines, databases)?
    * Can you share any relevant performance metrics or logs?
    * When did the issue first occur?
* **IAM Role Inconsistency:**
    * Which specific users are experiencing access issues?
    * What resources are they unable to access?

Once we have this information, we can start troubleshooting the issues effectively.
