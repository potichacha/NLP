We are experiencing critical issues with both the Mercury language compiler and our API gateway. The compiler is throwing unexpected errors for previously working code, and our API is experiencing frequent timeouts. This is impacting our production environment and requires immediate attention. We have tried restarting our services and reviewing recent code changes, but the issue persists. Please advise on how to resolve this urgently.
