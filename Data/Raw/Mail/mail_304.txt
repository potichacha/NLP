Dear Aetheros Support Team,

We are currently leveraging your IAM service and Cloud Management platform to manage access to our cloud resources. We have been impressed with the overall functionality, but have identified a potential improvement area.

Currently, we haven't found a streamlined way to automatically inherit roles for cloud resources based on their parent resource. For example, if a user has a specific role assigned at the project level, it would be efficient if those permissions automatically applied to any resources created within that project.

Implementing a feature like this would significantly reduce manual configuration and potential for errors, simplifying our overall access management strategy.

We believe this enhancement would greatly benefit users like us who heavily rely on your services for granular and efficient cloud resource management.

Thank you for considering this suggestion.

Sincerely,
Isiah Von
