Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing a critical issue with API response times for the API you developed for us. Since yesterday evening, requests to the API have been extremely slow, causing major disruptions to our application.

We are currently seeing response times of over 60 seconds, which is completely unacceptable for our users. This is severely impacting our business operations.

We need this resolved urgently. Please let us know what steps you are taking to investigate and fix this issue immediately.

Regards,
John Doe
