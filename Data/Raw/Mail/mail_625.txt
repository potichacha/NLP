Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working on integrating your IAM service with a new API we're developing using Aetheros API development services. I'm a bit confused about how to define roles that grant access to specific API endpoints. 

Could you please provide some documentation or examples on how to set granular permissions for different user roles within the IAM system when it comes to API access? 

Thanks,
John Doe
