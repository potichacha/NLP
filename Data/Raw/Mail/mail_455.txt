We've been experiencing a significant increase in false positives from our API monitoring setup over the past few hours. 

Specifically, we're seeing alerts for endpoint /v2/users that are reporting 500 errors, but upon investigation, the endpoint is functioning correctly and logs don't show any errors. 

This is causing significant disruption to our operations team as they're constantly investigating these false alarms. 

We need this resolved urgently. Please advise on next steps.
