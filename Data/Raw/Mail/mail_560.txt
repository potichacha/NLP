Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing critical issues deploying our Mercury application to the Aetheros Cloud. We're encountering persistent errors related to resource provisioning, and our attempts to debug using the provided documentation haven't been successful.

This is causing a major disruption to our operations. We need this resolved urgently.

Can you please assist ASAP?

Thanks,
