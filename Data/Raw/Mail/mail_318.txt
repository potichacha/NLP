Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing a critical issue where our API calls are failing authentication after a recent update to our IAM roles. We made changes to user permissions yesterday, and since then, our application cannot authenticate with the API. 

We are using your API development and IAM services. This issue is causing a major outage for our system. We need this resolved urgently.

Can you please investigate this issue as soon as possible and provide a solution? 

Thanks,
John Doe
