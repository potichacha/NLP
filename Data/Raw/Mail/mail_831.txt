Hi John,

We investigated the latency spikes you reported and identified the root cause was related to a temporary network congestion issue on our end. We have implemented a fix for this, and you should no longer experience these spikes. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
