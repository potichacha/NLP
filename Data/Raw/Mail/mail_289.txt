Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for the suggestion regarding our API Monitoring dashboard. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us. 

We understand how valuable customizable dashboards are, and we've actually received similar feedback from other users. We're happy to inform you that we are currently developing new features for the dashboard, including the ability to customize widgets and display specific metrics.

We don't have an exact release date yet, but we'll be sure to announce it once it's available. In the meantime, please let us know if you have any other suggestions or questions.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
