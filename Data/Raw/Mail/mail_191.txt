Hello Aetheros Support,

We've been using your Cloud Management and API Development services for the past few months and are largely satisfied. However, we've encountered a slight bottleneck in our deployment pipeline regarding the integration between these two services.

Currently, any updates to our APIs require manual configuration changes within the Cloud Management dashboard before deployment. This process is a bit cumbersome and slows down our release cycle. 

Is there a way to automate this process, perhaps through an API endpoint or webhook integration? This would streamline our workflow significantly.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
John Doe
