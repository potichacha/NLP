Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working on a project using Mercury and having some trouble understanding the best practices for error handling. Specifically, I'm unsure how to implement a try-catch equivalent in my code. 

Could you point me to some documentation or examples on how to handle errors gracefully in Mercury?

Thanks,
John Doe
