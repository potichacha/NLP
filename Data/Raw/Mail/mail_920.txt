Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble assigning specific roles to users within my organization. I'm trying to give a group of developers access to a particular API, but the role assignment doesn't seem to be working correctly. They are still getting authorization errors. 

Can you help me troubleshoot this?

Thanks,
John Doe
