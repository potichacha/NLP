Hi Aetheros Support,

We're evaluating Aetheros for managing our API ecosystem and are particularly interested in the IAM service and its capabilities for custom API role definitions.

Could you please provide more information on how granular we can get with role-based access control for our APIs built with Aetheros?

Specifically, we'd like to understand:

* Can we define roles that allow access to specific API endpoints or methods?
* Is it possible to restrict access to API resources based on user attributes or other contextual information?
* How does Aetheros handle role inheritance and conflicts?

We appreciate your insights on this.  Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
Isabella Martinez
