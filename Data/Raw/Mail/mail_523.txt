Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We're experiencing a significant spike in traffic and need to urgently scale up our cloud instances.  We've attempted to increase resources through your platform, but we're encountering errors.  Could you please advise on how to quickly resolve this?  We're losing customers by the minute.

Thanks,
John Doe
