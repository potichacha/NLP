Dear John,

We apologize for the delay in response. Our team has identified the root cause of the issue with the API Monitoring alerts. There was a misconfiguration in our system that prevented the alerts from being triggered correctly.

We have fixed the misconfiguration and confirmed that the alerts are now functioning as expected. We have also implemented additional monitoring and testing procedures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

We understand the inconvenience this issue may have caused and appreciate your patience while we worked towards a resolution.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
