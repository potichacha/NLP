Dear John,

We have identified the issue causing the IAM role assignment failures and have implemented a fix. Could you please try assigning the roles again and let us know if you encounter any further problems?

Regarding the Mercury deployment issue, we are still investigating the logs and configuration files you provided. We will provide an update on our findings by the end of the day tomorrow.

Thank you for your patience.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
