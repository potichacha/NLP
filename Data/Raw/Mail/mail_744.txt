Dear Isiah,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your valuable suggestion! We appreciate you taking the time to provide such detailed feedback.

We understand how integrating Mercury language features with our Cloud Management platform could significantly enhance your development and deployment workflows. The ability to manage infrastructure and deployments directly from your Mercury codebase aligns with our goal of providing a seamless and efficient development experience.

We have forwarded your suggestion to our product team for further evaluation. While we cannot promise immediate implementation, we will certainly consider it for future development plans.

In the meantime, please let us know if you have any other questions or suggestions. We are always happy to hear from you.

Best regards,
