Hello John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.

To grant read-only access to specific cloud resources, you can create a custom role and attach a policy that allows the 'List' and 'Get' actions on the desired resources. You can then assign this role to the specific team members.

For detailed steps and examples, please refer to our documentation on IAM Roles and Policies: [Link to documentation]

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
