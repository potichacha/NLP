Thanks for the response, but I'm still seeing a large portion of our costs attributed to 'Compute Resources' without a clear breakdown. Can you please advise further on how to see what specific resources are contributing to this?

Additionally, are there any tools within the Aetheros platform or best practices you recommend for optimizing our cloud resource usage and reducing costs?
