Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing a critical issue with the IAM service. We're unable to assign new roles to our users, and it's impacting our operations severely. 

We've tried the following troubleshooting steps:
- Verified our permissions
- Checked for any error messages in the logs (found nothing relevant)

We need this resolved ASAP. Please advise on next steps.

Thanks,
John Doe
