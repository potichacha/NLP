Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand the urgency of the situation and are looking into the compiler errors and API gateway timeouts you reported. 

Could you please provide us with the following information to assist in our investigation:

* Specific error messages from the Mercury compiler
* Logs from your API gateway around the time of the timeouts
* Version of the Mercury compiler and runtime you are using
* Any recent changes made to your API code or configuration

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution. 

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
