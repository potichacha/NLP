Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some difficulties scaling our cloud instance (ID: i-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8) over the past few days.  We're seeing significant performance drops during peak hours.

Could you please look into this and advise on how we can best optimize our scaling configuration?

Thanks,
John Doe
