Hi Aetheros Support,

We've gathered the requested information:

* Mercury Language SDK Version: 1.2.3
* Code Snippet: [Link to code snippet]
* IAM Role Configurations: [Attached JSON file]

We've also tried upgrading to the latest version of the Mercury SDK, but the issue persists. It seems there might be an underlying incompatibility with the current IAM authorization model.

Please let us know your findings and the next steps to resolve this critical issue. 

Thanks,
John
