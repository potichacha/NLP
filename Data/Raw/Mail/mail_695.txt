This is completely unacceptable. It has been over 5 hours and we have not received any concrete updates. Our business is severely impacted and we are losing thousands of dollars every hour because of this outage.

We need an immediate resolution or at least a concrete timeline for when this will be fixed. This is beyond critical at this point.
