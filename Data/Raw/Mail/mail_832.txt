We are experiencing a critical issue with our IAM integration.  Users are unable to access the resources they need. This is causing a major disruption to our operations. We need immediate assistance to resolve this.

Specifically, users are getting 'access denied' errors when trying to access resources they should have permissions for. We have not made any recent changes to our IAM configuration.
