Our production environment hosted on your cloud platform is currently experiencing a critical outage. The main application server (instance ID: i-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8) has become unresponsive, and we are unable to access any of our services. This is causing a complete halt to our operations and significant financial losses. 

We have tried restarting the instance from the management console, but it hasn't resolved the issue. We need immediate assistance to diagnose and rectify this problem as soon as possible. Please advise on the next steps and estimated time to resolution.
