Hi,

Here is the information you requested:

* **IAM Role Names:** DevTeam_ReadAccess, DevTeam_Deployment
* **Cloud Resources:** Primarily S3 buckets and EC2 instances in our us-west-2 region.
* **Error Messages:** Access Denied errors when attempting to list buckets or connect to instances.
* **Timeline:** Started around 8:00 AM UTC today.

We need a resolution as quickly as possible. Please advise if there are any workarounds in the meantime.

Thanks,
John
