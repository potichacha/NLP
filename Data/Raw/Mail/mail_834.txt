Our production environment is currently experiencing a critical outage. 

We are seeing errors related to instance scaling in our Cloud Management dashboard. New instances are not being provisioned, and our application is failing to handle the current load. 

This is a high-priority issue impacting our customers. Please advise on immediate steps for resolution.
