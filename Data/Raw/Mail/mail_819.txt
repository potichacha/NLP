Hi Support Team,

I figured out the issue. It turns out there was a null value for the "name" property in one of the objects within `someList`. My apologies for the false alarm.

However, it would be helpful if the Mercury language provided a more descriptive error message in such cases, perhaps indicating the index of the problematic object within the list.

Regards,
John
