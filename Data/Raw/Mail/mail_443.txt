Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some difficulties scaling our cloud resources effectively through your platform. Our application experiences periodic traffic spikes, and we're not seeing the automatic scaling we anticipated.

Could you please advise on how we can troubleshoot this?

Thanks,
John Doe
