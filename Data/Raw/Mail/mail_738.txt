Dear John,

Thank you for your valuable feedback on the Mercury language! We appreciate you taking the time to share your suggestions for improvement.

We understand the importance of detailed error messages and how they can significantly aid in debugging and troubleshooting. Your suggestion regarding incorporating more specific error types is insightful and aligns with our goal of making Mercury a more robust and developer-friendly language.

We will be reviewing our error handling system in the coming months as part of our roadmap for Mercury. While we cannot promise immediate implementation, we will definitely take your suggestions into serious consideration during our planning and development process. 

Thank you once again for your input! 

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
