Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.

Our Cloud Management service primarily uses CPU and RAM utilization metrics to trigger automatic scaling. By default, scaling up occurs when either metric consistently exceeds 80% for a predetermined period. 

You can definitely customize the scaling triggers! We offer a granular configuration panel within your Cloud Management dashboard where you can adjust the utilization thresholds and time periods that trigger scaling events. 

For more detailed instructions and advanced configuration options, please refer to our documentation: [Link to documentation]

If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
