Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest some improvements to the API Monitoring dashboard. While the current dashboard provides a good overview, I believe adding the following features would greatly enhance its usability:

1. **Customizable Time Range Presets:** It would be very helpful to have the ability to set custom time range presets (e.g., last 30 minutes, last 6 hours) beyond the default options.
2. **API Grouping and Filtering:**  With a large number of APIs being monitored, it becomes difficult to navigate and find specific data. Implementing API grouping and advanced filtering options would be highly beneficial.
3. **Alert Threshold Visualization:** Visually representing alert thresholds directly on the performance graphs would provide a clearer understanding of API health at a glance.

I believe these enhancements would significantly improve the user experience and provide greater insights into API performance.

Thank you for considering my suggestions.

Sincerely,
John Doe
