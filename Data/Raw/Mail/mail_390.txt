Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some unusual spikes in latency on our API for Project Phoenix. The API monitoring dashboard is flagging these as potential anomalies, but we haven't been able to pinpoint the root cause.

Could you please take a look and advise on how best to investigate this further?

Project Phoenix API ID: api-phoenix-7492

Thanks,
Isabella Rodriguez
