Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest a new feature for your API development services. It would be incredibly beneficial if you could add support for WebSockets.

As real-time data becomes more crucial for our web application, we're finding that traditional HTTP requests are not sufficient for our needs. WebSockets would allow us to build real-time features like live chat, notifications, and collaborative tools directly into our application.

I understand that adding support for a new technology like WebSockets can be a significant undertaking. Still, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your already impressive suite of services.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Sincerely,
Isabella Williams
