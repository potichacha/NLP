Hi Aetheros Support,

We've implemented the instance sizing changes and configured autoscaling as per your suggestions, and it seems to have improved the performance significantly. Thank you so much for your help!

However, we now have a quick question regarding our API monitoring. We've noticed some unusual spikes in request latency in the API Monitoring dashboard even during off-peak hours. Is this something to be concerned about, or could it be related to the recent changes we made?

Thanks again,
John Doe
