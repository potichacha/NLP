Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand the urgency of this issue and are here to help.

We have investigated the error message you provided and identified a potential conflict with your current resource limits in Aetheros Cloud Management and your AWS account settings.

To resolve this, our team will need to access your account and make some adjustments. Could you please provide temporary access to your Aetheros Cloud Management dashboard?

We will keep you updated on our progress.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
