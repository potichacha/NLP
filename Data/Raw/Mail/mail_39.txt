Hi,

Here's the information you requested:

* **IAM Role Name:**  api-access-role-prod
* **API Endpoints:** Any endpoint under https://api.example.com/v1/*
* **Error Message:**  "Unauthorized: Invalid or missing credentials"
* **Time Issue First Noticed:**  Approximately 09:00 AM UTC today

We also noticed that our cloud resource utilization spiked around the same time, which might be related. Can you look into that as well?

Thanks,
John
