Hi Aetheros Support,

We recently migrated our application infrastructure to Aetheros Cloud and have been experiencing significantly higher latency on our API gateway ever since.

Before the migration, our average API response time was around 50ms. Now, we're seeing spikes up to 500ms, causing noticeable slowdowns for our users.

We've checked our application code and confirmed it's not the source of the problem. We suspect it might be related to the API gateway configuration in the new cloud environment.

Could you please investigate this issue urgently and help us identify the root cause of the increased latency?

Thanks,
John Doe
