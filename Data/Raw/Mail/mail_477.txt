Thanks for the response, but I couldn't find the specific information I was looking for in the documentation. Can you please elaborate on how to use your IAM service to control access to specific API endpoints?

For example, if we want to restrict certain API endpoints to only authenticated users with specific roles, how can we achieve that using your IAM service?

Thanks,
John
