We are experiencing critical compiler errors in our production environment with the Mercury language. Our applications are failing to build, causing a major outage. We need immediate assistance to resolve this issue.

Here are the error messages we are seeing:

```
[ERROR] Mercury Compiler v1.2.3
...
```

We have tried restarting our build servers and re-downloading the Mercury compiler, but the issue persists. Please advise on how to proceed as soon as possible.
