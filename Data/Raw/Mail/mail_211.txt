Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We've been experiencing severe issues with our API performance since approximately 9:30 AM EST today. Our Aetheros API monitoring dashboard shows a massive spike in latency and error rates across all our endpoints.

This is causing significant disruption to our services, and we need urgent assistance in identifying and resolving the issue. 

We've already checked our own infrastructure and haven't found any problems on our end.

Please advise as soon as possible.

Thanks,
John Doe
