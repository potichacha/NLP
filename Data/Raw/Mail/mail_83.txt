Hi Aetheros Support,

We are facing an urgent issue with our API Gateway.  We recently set up new roles and permissions in the Aetheros IAM service and applied them to our API Gateway. However,  we are encountering authorization errors when users try to access the API with these new roles.

The errors started appearing around [mention approximate time]. We haven't made any other changes to the API Gateway configuration recently.

Could you please help us resolve this issue as soon as possible?

Thanks,
