Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I've been using your API monitoring service for a few months now and overall I'm quite happy with it. However, I have a suggestion for the dashboard. 

It would be incredibly helpful if we could customize the dashboard widgets to display specific metrics more prominently. For example, I'd like to have a large widget showing the average response time for a particular endpoint group right at the top. 

Could you consider adding this customization feature in a future update?

Thanks,
John Doe
