Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble assigning a specific role to a user in my application. I'm using your IAM service and have defined custom roles. However, when I try to assign one of these roles, it doesn't seem to be applying the correct permissions.

Could you please help me understand what might be going wrong?

Thanks,
John Doe
