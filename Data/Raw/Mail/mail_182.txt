Hi Aetheros Support,

Thanks for getting back to us. Here's the information you requested:

* Latency issues began around: 2023-10-25, 14:00 UTC
* Affected endpoints: Primarily /orders and /products, but occasionally affecting others
* Error messages: We're seeing a mix of 504 Gateway Timeouts and occasional 500 Internal Server Errors during these periods of high latency.

Let me know if you require any further information from our end.

Regards,
John Doe
