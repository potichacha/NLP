Hi,

Thanks for the response, but this issue is time-sensitive. We need a quicker resolution. Our entire development team is blocked by this. 

I've attached the error logs and the relevant code snippet. We've confirmed that the compiler version is correct. 

Please escalate this to a senior engineer and provide a solution ASAP.

Best,
Isiah
