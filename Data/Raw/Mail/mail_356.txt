Hi,

Thanks for the response.  I've checked the documentation, but it doesn't specifically address the serialization issues I'm facing with Python. Are there any code examples or more detailed guides available?  

This is holding up our development, so a quicker resolution would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
John
