Hi Isabella,

Thank you for reaching out. We see the latency spikes you are referring to for Project Phoenix API (api-phoenix-7492). 

Our preliminary analysis indicates potential bottlenecks related to a recent Mercury language script update. Could you please confirm if you updated any Mercury scripts associated with this API recently? 

We'll continue to investigate from our end. In the meantime, providing more details on any recent changes might help us identify the issue faster.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
