Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having a bit of trouble understanding how to restrict user access to specific cloud resources within my application. I've set up different roles in the IAM service, but I can't seem to link these roles to specific resources within my cloud environment. 

Is there a way to achieve this level of granularity? 

Thanks,
John Doe
