Hi John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support.

We understand that you are experiencing issues with IAM role permissions. To help us investigate further, could you please provide us with the following information:

* The specific role name and permissions that are not being applied correctly.
* The resources that users are able to access when they should not have access.
* Any recent changes made to the role or permissions.

Once we have this information, we will be able to assist you further.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
