Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We understand that you are experiencing intermittent latency spikes with your API hosted on our cloud platform.

We have investigated your issue and found that there was a temporary network congestion issue in the data center where your application is hosted. This congestion may have contributed to the latency spikes you observed.

We have taken steps to resolve the network congestion issue, and we believe that the latency spikes should now be resolved. 

Please let us know if you continue to experience any further issues. We are here to help.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support
