Hi,

Here's the information you requested:

* **Roles:** 'Data Analyst' role cannot access the 'Sales Data' database, even though the role has been granted read permissions.
* **Permissions:** 'Marketing Team' role is able to delete resources in the 'Development' environment, even though they should only have read access.
* **Errors:** Users with the 'Data Analyst' role are getting 'Access Denied' errors when trying to query the 'Sales Data' database.
* **Affected Users:** All users assigned to the 'Data Analyst' and 'Marketing Team' roles are affected.
* **Affected Resources:** 'Sales Data' database and resources in the 'Development' environment.

This is causing major disruption to our operations. Please provide a solution ASAP.

Regards,
John
