Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm encountering a Null Pointer Exception when trying to access a database connection within a Mercury lambda function. I've verified the connection string and it seems correct. 

Here's a snippet of the code:

```mercury
let dbConnection = Database.connect(connectionString);
let result = dbConnection.query("SELECT * FROM users");
```

The exception is thrown on the `dbConnection.query` line. 

Could you please help me troubleshoot this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
