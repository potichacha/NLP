Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing a persistent issue with our application built using the Mercury language.  We are encountering Null Pointer Exceptions specifically when handling concurrent requests.  This is creating instability and errors for our users.

We've tried debugging on our end, but the nature of the issue makes it difficult to pinpoint the root cause. Could you provide some guidance or insights into how to approach this problem in the context of Mercury's concurrency model?

Thanks,
John Doe
