Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing an issue with our IAM role permissions. We've set up specific permissions for a role, but users assigned to that role are still able to access resources they shouldn't have access to.

This is causing a security concern, and we need this resolved urgently. 

Can you please help us troubleshoot this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
