Hi Aetheros Support,

We're evaluating your API development services for a new project, and we had a few questions about rate limiting:

1. Do you offer built-in rate limiting for APIs developed through your platform?
2. What level of granularity is available for setting rate limits (e.g., per user, per IP, per API key)?
3. Can we customize rate limit responses, or are they standardized?

We're hoping to find a solution that gives us fine-grained control over API usage to ensure performance and security. 

Thanks in advance for your help.

Sincerely,
John Doe
