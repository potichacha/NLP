Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing a critical issue in our production environment. Our Mercury code is failing to compile after updating to the latest version of the Mercury compiler.

The error message we are getting is: "Unknown identifier 'Http'". We have checked our code and the documentation, but we are unable to resolve this issue.

Our application is currently down, and this is causing significant disruption to our business. We need urgent assistance to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

Please let us know what information you need from us to help diagnose and resolve this issue.

Thanks,
John Doe
