Hi,

Thanks for the quick response. 

The endpoint experiencing the issue is: `/api/v2/processOrder`

I've attached the relevant API logs. 

We haven't made any recent changes to our code, but we did update our AWS load balancer configuration yesterday.

Let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks,
John
