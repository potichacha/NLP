We are using Mercury Language version 2.3.1 and IAM service version 1.5.2. Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of the issue, we cannot share our codebase. 

However, we can confirm that the vulnerability exists when defining custom roles with specific resource permissions and then utilizing the `AuthorizeUser` function in our Mercury code.  We have run extensive tests and can replicate this issue consistently. 

We need a solution or workaround urgently as this vulnerability poses a significant risk to our application and data.
