Hi Kenneth,

Thank you for providing the details. We have identified the issue. It appears there was a slight misconfiguration on our end regarding the 'Data Analyst' role permissions. This has been rectified now. 

Could you please try logging out and logging back in to the platform? This should refresh your permissions and grant you access to the analytics dashboards.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused.

Best Regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
