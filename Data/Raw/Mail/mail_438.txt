Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest a potentially valuable integration between your IAM service and your Cloud Management platform.

Currently, we're using both services and have found ourselves wanting a more streamlined way to assign cloud resource permissions based on IAM roles. It would be incredibly useful if we could directly link specific cloud resources (like databases or server instances) to pre-defined roles within the IAM service.

This would simplify our access control management significantly and reduce the potential for errors. 

Could you consider this as a potential feature enhancement? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

Thanks,
