Hello Aetheros Support,

I'm experiencing difficulties integrating Mercury language functions with our cloud resources managed through Aetheros. 

Specifically, I'm facing challenges when trying to access a cloud database using a Mercury script. The script seems to be unable to authenticate correctly with the IAM service, even though I've assigned the necessary roles and permissions. 

Could you please provide guidance on how to troubleshoot this issue? 

Thanks,
John Doe
