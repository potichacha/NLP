We are experiencing critical issues deploying our Mercury application to the Aetheros Cloud.  We are encountering a "Resource Limit Exceeded" error, but we believe our allocated resources should be sufficient. 

We have checked the following:
- Confirmed resource limits in our cloud management console.
- Reviewed recent changes to our Mercury codebase.

This is a high-priority issue as it is preventing us from deploying a critical update to our system. Please advise on how to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
