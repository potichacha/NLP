Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for the valuable feedback! We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on how we can improve our API monitoring dashboard. 

Your suggestion about visualizing min, max, and percentile response times is excellent, and we agree it would provide a more comprehensive view of API performance. We've added it to our development roadmap, and our team will explore the best way to implement this enhancement.

While we can't provide an exact timeline for implementation, we'll keep you updated on our progress.

In the meantime, if you have any other suggestions or questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
