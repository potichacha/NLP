Aetheros Support,

We're getting a 500 Internal Server Error. We haven't made any recent changes to the API or our systems. I've attached the error logs as requested.

This is severely impacting our operations, and we need this fixed ASAP. Please escalate this to your senior engineers.

Regards,
John
