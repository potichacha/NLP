Hello Aetheros Support,

I'm experiencing an issue integrating Mercury language functions with our IAM service. 
Specifically, I'm trying to implement role-based access control to certain API endpoints defined in Mercury, but the IAM roles don't seem to be recognized within the Mercury code. 

Is there a specific configuration needed for this integration to work correctly? I've followed the documentation, but I might be missing something. 

Also, I've noticed some inconsistencies in the API monitoring dashboard related to these calls.  Sometimes they appear, sometimes not. Could this be related?

Thanks,
John Doe
