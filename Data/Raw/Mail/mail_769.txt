Dear John,

We have identified the root cause of the API performance issue. It was due to an unexpected surge in traffic from a specific geographic location. We have implemented rate limiting to mitigate this and are currently monitoring the situation closely.

The API response times should be back to normal now. Please confirm if the issue persists on your end.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused. Let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
