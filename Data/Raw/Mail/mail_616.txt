Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand the urgency of this issue and are looking into the latency spikes you're experiencing with your API gateway after migrating to Aetheros Cloud.

To assist us in our investigation, could you please provide the following information:

* The approximate date and time you started noticing the increased latency.
* Screenshots of the latency spikes from your API monitoring dashboard.
* Details about your Aetheros Cloud region and the specific API gateway instance you're using.

Once we have this information, we'll be able to investigate further and provide a solution as quickly as possible.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
