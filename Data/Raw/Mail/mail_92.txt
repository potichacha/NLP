Hi,

Here's the information you requested:

* **Affected users:** All users within our organization (approximately 50 users)
* **Time of issue:** Around 08:00 AM UTC
* **Recent changes:** We performed a routine security audit yesterday and revoked some unused API keys, but we didn't make any changes directly to IAM roles or permissions.

Please let me know if you need anything else.
