Hi Support Team,

Thanks for the response. I'm using Mercury version 2.5.1. We are configuring the IAM roles directly within our cloud management console, not within the Mercury code itself. We are using the predefined roles provided by Aetheros. We expect the API to automatically enforce these roles.

I haven't included a code snippet as we're not explicitly handling role validation in our code. We were under the impression that this was handled automatically by Aetheros when using your platform.

Could there be a misconfiguration on the cloud management side that is preventing the roles from being properly applied?

Regards,
John
