Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent latency spikes on our staging server hosted on your cloud platform over the past few days. The spikes are sporadic and don't seem to follow a pattern. 

We've checked our application logs and haven't found anything conclusive.

Could you please investigate this issue and provide assistance in resolving it?

Thanks,
John Doe
