Hi,

Here is the information you requested:

* **Roles and Permissions:** The "Data Analyst" role is not able to access the production database, even though the role has been granted read access in the IAM console. Conversely, the "Intern" role is able to access sensitive data they should not have permission to view.
* **Usernames:** Affected users include data analysts: jane.doe@example.com, peter.jones@example.com. We have also observed the intern, sam.wilson@example.com, accessing restricted data. 
* **Error Messages:** Users with the "Data Analyst" role receive a generic "Access Denied" message when attempting to access the production database.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

Regards,
John Smith
