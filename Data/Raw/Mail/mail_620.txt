Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been using your API monitoring solution for a few months now and are very pleased with its features and performance. However, we've noticed that the default alert threshold for latency spikes is a bit too sensitive for our use case. We often receive alerts for minor spikes that don't necessarily indicate a real issue.

It would be great if you could consider adding an option to customize the latency spike alert threshold. This would allow us to fine-tune the sensitivity and reduce the number of false positives we receive.

Thank you for considering this suggestion.

Sincerely,
John Doe
