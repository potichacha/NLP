Dear Kenneth,

Thank you for providing the additional information. Our team has investigated the issue and found a known bug in version 1.2.5 of the Mercury language library that causes discrepancies in the monitoring data. 

We have released a hotfix in version 1.2.6, which addresses this issue. Please update your library to the latest version. 

Regarding the "Type mismatch" error, it seems unrelated to the monitoring issue. Could you please share the relevant code snippet from line 42? This will help us pinpoint the exact cause of the error.

Let us know if you have any further questions.

Best Regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
