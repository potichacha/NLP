Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand you're facing issues with asynchronous function calls in Mercury. 

We've reviewed your code snippet and identified a minor syntax error that's preventing the async functionality from working as intended.  

To resolve this, could you please change [previous code snippet] to [corrected code snippet]? This should ensure your functions execute asynchronously. 

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
