We are experiencing critical issues with our Aetheros integration.

1.  Our monitoring dashboards are showing "Access Denied" errors for several API endpoints that were working previously. This is causing major disruption to our operations.
2.  We are also unable to manage user roles within the IAM service.  Attempts to change permissions are resulting in errors.  

This is a high-priority issue. We need immediate assistance to resolve this. Please contact us as soon as possible.
