Hi John,

Thank you for providing the details. We've identified the issue. The 'aetheros:mercury:DeployCode' action in your policy should be 'aetheros:deploy'.

Please update your 'MercuryDeployer' role's policy to include the correct action:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "aetheros:deploy"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you've updated the policy, please attempt the deployment again. It should now succeed. Let us know if you face any further issues.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
