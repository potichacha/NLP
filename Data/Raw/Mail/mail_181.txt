Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand that you are experiencing high latency issues with your API. 

We have checked our monitoring systems, and we are not seeing any widespread issues at this time. To help us investigate further, could you please provide us with the following information:

*  The approximate time the latency issues started occurring
*  The specific API endpoints affected

Once we have this information, we will be able to investigate further and provide you with an update.
