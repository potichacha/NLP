Hi Support Team,

Here's the information you requested:

* **Permissions:**  'resource:read', 'resource:write'
* **Custom Role Name:** 'DevOpsEngineer'
* **Error Message:** 'Invalid permissions specified for role.'

We're unsure why these permissions are invalid, as they seem standard. 

Thanks,
John
