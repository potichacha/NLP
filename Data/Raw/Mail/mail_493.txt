Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble deploying a Mercury application to AWS using your Cloud Management platform.  I'm receiving a "Resource Limit Exceeded" error, but I believe I should have sufficient resources available in my account. 

Can you please help me troubleshoot this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
