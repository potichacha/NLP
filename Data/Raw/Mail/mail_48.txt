We're experiencing a critical issue with our Aetheros IAM integration. Our production API calls are failing due to incorrect permissions, causing a major outage. We need immediate assistance to resolve this. 

Specifically, users with the "Editor" role are suddenly unable to access endpoints they could access yesterday. We haven't made any changes to our IAM configuration recently. 

Please advise ASAP.
