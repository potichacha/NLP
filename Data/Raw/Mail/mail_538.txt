Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been trying to integrate Mercury language into our existing API infrastructure for the past few days, but we're encountering some roadblocks. Specifically, we're facing challenges with:

1. **Data Type Compatibility:** Our existing system relies heavily on custom data structures. We're struggling to find clear documentation on how to seamlessly map these structures with Mercury's native data types.
2. **Error Handling:** The error messages we're receiving during compilation and runtime are quite cryptic. It's difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the errors and debug them efficiently.

We're hoping for some guidance and potential solutions to these problems. Our project timeline is tight, so any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
