Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing a critical issue with the IAM service. We've set up specific roles and permissions, but they don't seem to be applying correctly. Some users are granted access to resources they shouldn't have, while others are denied access to resources they need.

This is causing major disruptions to our operations. We need this resolved urgently.

Please advise on next steps.

Regards,
John Smith
