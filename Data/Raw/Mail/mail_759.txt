Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble finding clear documentation on how to implement user authentication in Mercury language. The existing documentation seems outdated and doesn't cover the specific IAM integration I need.

Could you please point me to the correct resources or provide some guidance on this?

Thanks,
John Doe
