We are experiencing a critical issue in our production environment where new IAM role assignments are failing. This is preventing our team from accessing critical cloud resources. 

We are using Aetheros Cloud Management and IAM services. We have verified that the roles and policies are correctly configured in the IAM service, but the assignments are not being reflected in our cloud environment.

We have tried the following:
- Re-assigning the roles
- Checking for any error messages in the Aetheros console
- Verifying our network connectivity

However, the issue persists. This is causing a major disruption to our operations. We need urgent assistance to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
