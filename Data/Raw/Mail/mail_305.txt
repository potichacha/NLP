Dear Isiah,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support and for your valuable suggestion! We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts on how we can improve our IAM service and Cloud Management platform.

We understand the importance of streamlining role inheritance for cloud resources. Your suggestion about automatically inheriting roles based on the parent resource is very insightful, and we can see how it would be beneficial for many users.

We have forwarded your suggestion to our product team for their review and consideration. While we can't promise if or when this feature will be implemented, we assure you that we take all feedback seriously, and your input will help us prioritize future development.

In the meantime, we would be happy to explore potential workarounds or best practices that might be helpful for you. Would you be interested in scheduling a brief call with one of our engineers to discuss your specific use case in more detail?

Thank you once again for your feedback.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
