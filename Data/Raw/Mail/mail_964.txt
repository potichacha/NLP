Our team has been experiencing a critical issue with Aetheros API Monitoring for the past few hours. 

We are not seeing any data populated in the dashboard and, more concerningly, alerts configured for critical endpoints are not firing. 

This is causing major disruption to our services as we lack visibility and are flying blind on potential issues. 

Please advise on the situation and steps for immediate resolution ASAP.
