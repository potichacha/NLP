We are experiencing a critical issue with the IAM service. We have a new role defined that needs access to specific API endpoints, but despite applying the correct permissions, we are getting authorization errors. 

This is preventing us from deploying a critical update to our production environment. We need this resolved ASAP.

Here are the details:

* **Role name:** ProdDeploymentRole
* **API endpoints:** /v1/orders, /v1/customers
* **Permissions:** read, write

We have already tried revoking and re-applying the permissions, but the issue persists. Please advise on how to proceed.
