Dear John,

Our team has investigated the scaling issues you reported. We've identified a configuration issue within your cloud environment that was preventing resources from scaling properly during peak hours. We have corrected this configuration.

Please monitor your application's performance over the next few days and let us know if you encounter any further problems.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
