Hi John,

We've reviewed the information you provided and identified the issue. There's currently a temporary restriction on new t2.medium instances in us-east-1. 

We recommend trying a different instance type, such as t3.medium, or deploying to an alternative region.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
