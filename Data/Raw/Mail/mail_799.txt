Hi John,

Thank you for providing the additional information. Our team has investigated the latency spikes and identified the root cause as an issue with our load balancing configuration.

We have implemented a fix, and the monitoring dashboard should now reflect normal latency levels. Please monitor your API performance and let us know if you encounter any further issues.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
