Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* **API Endpoints:** Primarily affecting `/users` and `/products` endpoints.
* **Time Frame:**  The spikes started appearing yesterday around 2 PM UTC and are recurring intermittently.
* **Recent Changes:** We deployed a minor update to our authentication service yesterday around 1 PM UTC.

Let me know if you need any further details.

Regards,
John
