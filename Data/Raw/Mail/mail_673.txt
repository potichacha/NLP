Hi Aetheros Support,

Thanks for the quick response.

Here is the information you requested:

* **Mercury compiler version:** 1.2.3
* **Operating system:** Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS
* **Code snippet:** 

```mercury
import Http from "@aetheros/http"

function main() {
  // Code using Http module
}
```

This is a simplified example, but it replicates the issue we are facing. We are confident the error lies within the latest compiler update, as this code worked seamlessly before the upgrade.

Please advise on any potential solutions or workarounds. Our production environment remains down, and we're eager to get it back up and running.

Best regards,
John
