We are experiencing a critical issue with the Aetheros IAM service. We are unable to assign specific roles to users within our organization, causing significant disruption to our workflow. The roles appear to be correctly configured in the system, but attempts to assign them result in errors. This is affecting our ability to manage access control, and we need this resolved urgently. Please advise on immediate steps to troubleshoot and rectify this issue.
