Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing significant latency issues with our new API hosted on the Aetheros platform. This started around [mention approximate time] and is impacting our live application.

We are seeing response times of over [mention specific high response time] for [mention specific API endpoints or actions affected]. Our application requires a response time of under [mention your expected response time] to function properly.

We have already reviewed our code and confirmed that the issue is not on our end. We suspect it might be related to the API gateway configuration or load balancing.

Could you please investigate this issue urgently and provide an update as soon as possible?

Thank you,
John Doe
