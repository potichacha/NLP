Hi Aetheros Support,

My application, 'Foodie Reviews', deployed on your cloud platform, has been experiencing intermittent outages and slowdowns since this morning. We're seeing a huge spike in traffic that we anticipated, but your auto-scaling doesn't seem to be handling it properly.  

Could you please look into this immediately? Our users are heavily impacted. We need this fixed ASAP.

Thanks,
John Doe
