Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble deploying a Mercury language application to AWS using Aetheros's Cloud Management service. 

I've followed the documentation, but I keep encountering an error during the deployment stage. The error message isn't very descriptive, and I'm not sure how to troubleshoot it.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
