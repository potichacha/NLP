Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing unusually high latency with one of our production APIs (API key: adk-789xyz123) since this morning. The API was developed using your platform and has been performing well until now.

We're seeing average response times of over 2 seconds, which is impacting our users. Could you please look into this issue and advise on any potential solutions?

Thanks,
John Doe
