Hello Aetheros Support,

We are evaluating Aetheros for our API management needs and are particularly interested in the IAM service and its integration with the API Gateway.

Could you please provide some information on how granular we can get with role-based access control for our APIs? Specifically, can we define permissions based on:

* HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Specific API endpoints or resources
* Request headers or payload data

We are also interested in understanding how these roles can be managed programmatically through your APIs or SDKs. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,
Isabella Fernandez
