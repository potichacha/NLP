Hi John,

You can definitely use our IAM service to manage resources across different cloud accounts. We recommend setting up a centralized IAM account and then using cross-account roles to grant permissions to users and resources in other accounts. 

Our documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up cross-account access: [Link to documentation]

Let us know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
