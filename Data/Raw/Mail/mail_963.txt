Compiler version: v1.2.3

Code Snippet:
```
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  items.forEach(item => {
    total += item.price * item.quantity;
  });
  return total
}
```

We haven't made any recent changes to our environment, but we did update the Mercury compiler yesterday from v1.2.2 to v1.2.3. This issue started occurring immediately after the update.
