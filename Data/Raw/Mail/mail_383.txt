Hi Support Team,

Thanks for the prompt response.  Here are the details you requested:

* **Instance Types:** We're primarily using the standard C4 instances (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) for our application servers.
* **Autoscaling:** We have configured autoscaling to trigger when CPU utilization goes beyond 70%, with a maximum of 10 instances.
* **Database:** We're using your managed PostgreSQL database service, with a 1TB standard storage plan.
* **Traffic:** During peak hours (around 7 PM - 9 PM UTC), we get around 5,000 requests per minute.

We initially believed these settings would suffice, but the performance issues persist. We suspect there might be an issue with how our Mercury code interacts with the API during scaling events. Could you advise if there are any known limitations or best practices for handling such scenarios in Mercury?

Regards,
Isiah
