Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent latency spikes with our APIs being monitored by your platform for the past few hours.  This is causing significant performance issues for our users.

We need this resolved ASAP. Please advise on the situation and estimated resolution time.

Thanks,
John Doe
