Hi Support Team,

Here's the information you requested:

* We started noticing the latency spikes on October 26th, shortly after completing the cloud migration.
* Please find attached screenshots showing the latency spikes on our API monitoring dashboard.
* We are using the Aetheros Cloud region 'us-east-1' and our API gateway instance ID is 'agw-1234567890abcdef0'.

Let me know if you need anything else from our end.

Regards,
John
