Our team is experiencing a critical issue with API Monitoring. We are not seeing any data populated on the dashboard for our production APIs since yesterday evening. 

This is a major disruption to our operations as we rely heavily on your monitoring service for real-time insights and incident response.

Please investigate this issue with utmost urgency and provide an update at the earliest.

John Doe
