Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We understand you're looking for more information regarding role-based access control for API Monitoring dashboards.

To better assist you, could you please provide us with more context on your current setup?  Specifically, what type of subscription do you have with Aetheros, and have you already begun defining custom roles within our IAM service?

Once we have a clearer understanding of your needs, we can guide you through the appropriate steps to achieve the desired permissions for your API Monitoring dashboards. 

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
