Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We understand you're experiencing difficulties with data reflection in your application despite successful API calls showing in the monitoring logs.

To assist you better, could you please provide us with the following:

* The relevant snippet of your Mercury code where you are making the API call and processing the response.
* A screenshot of your API monitoring dashboard showing the successful calls.
* Any error messages or unusual logs from your application.

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
