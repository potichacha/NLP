Hi John,

We apologize for the delay.  You are correct, the current version of our IAM service does not support restricting roles to specific regions. This is a feature we are planning to implement in the near future. 

In the meantime, you can achieve a similar level of control by using resource tagging and then configuring your cloud management policies to enforce restrictions based on those tags.

We understand this might not be ideal, and we appreciate your patience while we work on implementing the region-specific role functionality.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
