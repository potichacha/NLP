Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm evaluating your IAM service for our web application and had a question about role inheritance. 

Specifically, if we define a parent role with certain permissions, can we create child roles that inherit those permissions and also have additional, specific permissions?

Could you please provide some documentation or examples of how this works in practice?

Thanks,
Isiah Rippin
