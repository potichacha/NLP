Hi Aetheros Support,

We are facing a critical issue where our IAM roles are not being applied correctly to our cloud resources. This is causing outages and preventing our team from accessing essential services. 

Specifically, we are seeing issues with roles created for our development team. They are unable to access the resources they need, even though the roles seem to be correctly configured in the IAM service. 

We need this resolved ASAP as it's impacting our operations severely. Please advise on the next steps.

Regards,
John Doe
