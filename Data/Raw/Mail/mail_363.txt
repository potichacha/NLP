Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I've been using Mercury for a few months now and while I appreciate its simplicity for rapid API development, I believe the error handling mechanisms could be improved.

Currently, the error messages are a bit cryptic and don't offer much context for debugging. It would be incredibly helpful if you could provide more detailed error messages that pinpoint the exact location and cause of the error within the Mercury code.

This improvement would greatly enhance the developer experience and make debugging much smoother. 

Thanks,
John Doe
