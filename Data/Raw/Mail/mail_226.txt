Dear Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to propose an enhancement for the Mercury language regarding API error handling. While Mercury significantly streamlines API development, I believe incorporating a more robust and standardized error handling mechanism would greatly benefit developers.

Currently, error handling in Mercury feels a bit fragmented. It would be incredibly helpful if the language could provide built-in functionalities or conventions for:

* Defining custom error types specific to our API domain.
* Handling exceptions in a more structured way, perhaps using try-catch blocks or similar constructs.
* Generating consistent error responses across different API endpoints.

This enhancement would not only make our APIs more resilient but also simplify debugging and error tracking. It would contribute to a more developer-friendly experience when working with Mercury for API development.

Thank you for considering my suggestion. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this and discuss it further.

Sincerely,
John Doe
