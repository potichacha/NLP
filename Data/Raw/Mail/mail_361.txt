Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm evaluating the Mercury language for a new project, and I had a question about how it handles concurrency. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding:

* What concurrency models does Mercury support (e.g., threads, actors, coroutines)?
* Are there any built-in mechanisms for managing shared resources and preventing race conditions?
* Could you provide some examples of how concurrency is typically handled in Mercury code?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Sincerely,
John Doe
