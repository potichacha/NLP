We are facing a critical issue with the IAM service integration within our Mercury language application. We have discovered a potential security vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. 

Specifically, the issue arises when using the `AuthorizeUser` function in Mercury with custom roles defined in the IAM service. We have observed that under certain conditions, users assigned to these custom roles can bypass intended access restrictions.

This is a high-priority issue for us, and we require immediate assistance in resolving it. Please provide guidance on how to mitigate this vulnerability and ensure the security of our application.
