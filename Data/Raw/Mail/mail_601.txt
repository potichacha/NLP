Hi Aetheros Support,

Thanks for the quick response.

* We're currently using the automated horizontal scaling option.
* I've attached a screenshot of the performance metrics from yesterday's peak period.
* We haven't made any significant changes to our application recently. However, we did update our cloud infrastructure settings last week.

Let me know if you require any further information.

Regards,
John Doe
