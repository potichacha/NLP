Aetheros Support,

The IAM interface is timing out. We've tried different browsers and cleared the cache, but the issue persists. We need this resolved ASAP as it's blocking our critical operations. 

Regarding the security group, can you please check if port 3306 is open for inbound traffic from our application server security group?

Thanks,
John Doe
