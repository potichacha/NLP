Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement to the error reporting in Mercury Language. Currently, the error messages can be a bit cryptic and difficult to debug, especially when working with the API monitoring integration.

It would be incredibly helpful if the error messages could be more verbose and include:

* **Context:**  The specific line of code or function where the error occurred.
* **Possible Causes:** A brief explanation of what might have caused the error.
* **Suggested Solutions:**  Potential fixes or workarounds for the error.

This would significantly speed up our development process and reduce the time spent on debugging. Thanks for considering this suggestion!

Sincerely,
John Doe
