Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm encountering a persistent Null Pointer Exception when using a lambda expression within the Mercury language. 

Here's a snippet of the code: 

```mercury
let myLambda = (x) => x.getProperty("name");
let result = someList.map(myLambda);
```

The error occurs on the `map` function call, specifically when the lambda attempts to access `getProperty("name")`. I've ensured that `someList` is not null and contains valid objects. Could you please advise on how to resolve this?

Thanks,
John Doe
