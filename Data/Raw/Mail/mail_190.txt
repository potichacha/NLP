Hi John,

Thank you for providing the additional information. Our team has investigated the latency spikes and identified a correlation with the recent update to your authentication service. 

We've pinpointed the issue to a specific function call in the updated code that's causing a slight delay. We've prepared a hotfix for this issue, and we'll be deploying it within the next hour. 

We expect the latency spikes to be resolved once the hotfix is deployed. We'll continue to monitor the situation closely. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please let us know if you experience any further issues.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
