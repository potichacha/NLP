Hi Aetheros Support,

Our API monitoring dashboard has stopped updating within the last hour. We're not seeing any new data come in, and this is impacting our ability to monitor our systems effectively.

We've tried logging out and back in, but the issue persists. 

Could you please look into this urgently?

Thanks,
John Doe
