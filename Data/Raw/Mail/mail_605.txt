Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing problems with assigning specific permissions to a custom role in the IAM service. The role is preventing our developers from accessing the resources they need. We've reviewed the documentation and haven't found a solution. 

Could you provide some assistance?

Thanks,
John Doe
