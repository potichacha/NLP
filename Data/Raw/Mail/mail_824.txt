Hi Aetheros Support,

We're currently evaluating your API monitoring and IAM services for our web application. We're particularly interested in understanding how seamlessly these two services integrate.

Specifically, we'd like to know if it's possible to:

1. **Trigger automated alerts within the API monitoring platform based on specific IAM events.** For instance, if a user's role changes, we want to be notified through the API monitoring dashboard.
2. **Utilize user roles and permissions defined within the IAM service to control access to specific API monitoring dashboards and metrics.**

Could you please provide some insights or documentation on these integration capabilities?

Thank you,
John Doe
