Hi Aetheros Support,

Please find attached the timestamps of the recent occurrences and a list of recent modifications to our infrastructure.

We noticed a spike in traffic just before the issues began, potentially related to a new marketing campaign launch. However, we scaled our resources according to our usual procedures and haven't encountered such severe latency before.

Let me know if you require any further information.

Regards,
John Doe
