Here's the information you requested:

* **IAM Role Name:**  DataProcessingRole
* **Actions/Resources:** The role should allow read/write access to S3 buckets prefixed with 'companydata-', but these actions are being denied.
* **Recent Changes:**  We migrated our application to a new VPC yesterday, which involved updating some security groups. 

Let me know if you need any further information.
