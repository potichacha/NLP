Hi,

Here is the information you requested:

* Role name: `data_analyst`
* Permissions: This role should only have read access to our data warehouse tables prefixed with `analytics_`.
* Issue: Users with this role are able to query and modify tables outside of the `analytics_` prefix.
* Recent changes: We added a new data source to our warehouse yesterday, but no changes were made to the `data_analyst` role permissions.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
John
