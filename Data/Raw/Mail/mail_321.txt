Dear John,

We have identified the issue. There was a bug in our recent update that caused incorrect permissions to be applied to the 'Data Analyst' role. 

A fix has been implemented, and the IAM permissions should now be working correctly. Can you please confirm if the issue is resolved on your end?

We apologize for the inconvenience this issue caused.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
