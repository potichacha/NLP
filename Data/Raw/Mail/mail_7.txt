Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing urgent issues deploying our Mercury code to production. We are consistently getting a 502 error, and our API monitoring dashboard is showing a spike in errors.

This is causing a major outage for our services. We have checked our code and cannot identify the issue. Can you please investigate ASAP?

Thanks,
John Doe
