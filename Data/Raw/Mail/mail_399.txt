We are experiencing significant latency with our API gateway managed by Aetheros. This is impacting our production environment and causing major disruptions for our customers. 

We have observed response times exceeding several seconds for API calls that normally take milliseconds. This issue started appearing around [mention approximate time issue began].

We are using the following:
* Aetheros API Gateway
* Cloud Management platform (for the infrastructure hosting the gateway)

We have already checked our application code and confirmed it's not the source of the problem. 

Please advise on how to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
