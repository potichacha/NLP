We have identified the issue and resolved it.  The problem was related to a recent platform update that inadvertently affected user permissions. We have rolled back the update and confirmed that API access and user role management are now functioning normally.  We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this downtime.  We are continuously working to improve our services and prevent such incidents in the future.
