Hi Aetheros Support,

We are having an urgent issue with the role assignment feature in your IAM service. We are unable to assign specific roles to new users, and it's impacting our operations.

We have tried the following:
* Double-checked the role permissions.
* Ensured the users are in the correct groups.
* Logged out and back into the system.

However, the issue persists. Could you please look into this urgently?

Thanks,
John Doe
