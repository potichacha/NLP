Hi Aetheros Support,

Here is the information you requested:

* **Error message:** "Deployment failed. See logs for more details."
* **Troubleshooting steps:**
    * Verified AWS credentials are correct.
    * Checked network connectivity.
    * Restarted the deployment process.
* **Aetheros account ID:** 1234567890

The logs don't provide any specific error codes or messages that would help me identify the problem.

Thanks,
John Doe
