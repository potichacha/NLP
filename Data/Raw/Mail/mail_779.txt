Dear Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest a potentially valuable addition to the Mercury language: support for async/await syntax.

As you know, asynchronous programming is crucial for building high-performance web applications.  While Mercury offers ways to handle asynchronous operations,  having dedicated async/await keywords would significantly enhance code readability and maintainability.

Many modern languages have adopted this feature with great success, making asynchronous code almost as straightforward as synchronous code. I believe implementing async/await in Mercury would greatly benefit the developer experience and make the language even more powerful.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Sincerely,
Isiah Schmeler
