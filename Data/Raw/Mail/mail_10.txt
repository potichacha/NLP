Hi John,

Our team has identified the issue. There was a temporary problem with our authentication service that was causing the 502 errors. This has now been resolved. 

Can you please try deploying your code again and let us know if you encounter any further issues?

We apologize for the inconvenience caused. 

Best regards,
