Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing significant delays in API response times for our application which is built using your API development services. This is causing major disruptions to our operations.

We have been observing this issue for the past few hours and it seems to be getting worse. Our initial investigation suggests it might be related to the API endpoint for [mention specific endpoint]. 

Could you please investigate this urgently and provide an update as soon as possible?

Thanks,
John Doe
