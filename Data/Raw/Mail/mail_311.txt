Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing intermittent but severe latency issues with our API that's been integrated with your API monitoring solution. This is causing significant disruption to our customers.

The latency spikes started around [mention approximate time] today, and we haven't been able to pinpoint the cause. We haven't made any recent changes to our API codebase.

We need immediate assistance in investigating and resolving this issue. Please advise on the next steps.

Sincerely,
John Doe
