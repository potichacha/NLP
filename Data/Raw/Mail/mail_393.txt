Hi Isabella,

We are observing stabilized API performance following your script revert. The latency spikes have subsided. Our analysis confirms the recent Mercury script update was contributing to the performance bottleneck. 

We will further analyze the script to provide recommendations for optimizing its performance within your API workflow. We'll be in touch soon with our findings and potential solutions.

Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
