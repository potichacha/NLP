Hi Isabella,

We have identified the issue. It seems there was a delay in synchronizing your new role permissions within our IAM system. This has now been rectified.

Please try logging in again. You should now have access to the API dashboard. 

We apologize for the inconvenience caused. 

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
