Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been encountering two issues lately:

1. **Scaling Issues:** Our application experiences significant slowdown during peak hours, even with the auto-scaling configured in your cloud management platform. It seems like the scaling isn't triggering quickly enough to handle the load.

2. **IAM Role Permissions:** We're facing inconsistencies with our custom roles and permissions in the IAM service. Some users with seemingly correct permissions are unable to access specific resources. This is causing disruptions in our workflow.

Could you please look into these matters urgently? 

Thanks,
John Doe
