Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* **Timeframe:** The errors began occurring around Tuesday afternoon (October 24th) shortly after we deployed the new version.
* **Frequency:** The frequency varies, but we're seeing them about 2-3 times per hour on average.
* **Request details:** Most requests to this endpoint are simple GET requests. Here's an example:

```
GET /api/v2/products HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <redacted>

```

* **Error logs:**  I've attached a snippet of our server logs showing the 502 errors.

Please let me know if you require any further information.

Thanks,
Isabella
