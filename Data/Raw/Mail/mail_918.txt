Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* Cloud platform: AWS
* Instance type: m5.large
* Peak CPU usage: Consistently above 90%
* Peak memory consumption: Around 70%

We believe switching to a larger instance size might help, but we're not sure which one would be most cost-effective while still providing the necessary performance boost.

Thanks,
John
