Hi Aetheros Support,

Thanks for the quick response. Here is the information you requested:

- **Affected IAM Roles:** Data Engineer, Security Analyst
- **Policies:** ReadOnlyAccess, S3FullAccess
- **Cloud Environment:** AWS us-east-1

We're not seeing any specific error messages in either the Aetheros or AWS consoles. However, when we check the IAM roles assigned to the affected users in the AWS console, the new roles are not reflected.

Please let us know if you need any further information.

Thanks,
John Doe
