Hi,

Here's the information you requested:

* **Timeframe:** Started around October 20th.
* **Frequency:** Sporadic, seemingly random. Sometimes multiple times an hour, other times nothing for several hours.
* **Affected APIs:** Primarily affecting our payment processing API (endpoints /payment/process and /payment/verify).
* **Cloud Platform:** We're using AWS.
* **Recent Changes:** We did deploy an update to our API on October 18th, but it was a minor update and shouldn't have caused these issues.

Let me know what you find.

Regards,
Kenneth
