Hi Support Team,

Here is the information you requested:

* We first noticed the issue yesterday around 3:00 PM UTC. It has happened intermittently since then, with the latest occurrence just 10 minutes ago.
* We haven't been able to identify any specific actions or events that trigger the problem.
* It seems to affect a random subset of users each time, roughly 5-10% of our user base.

We are concerned about the impact this is having on our operations and would greatly appreciate a prompt resolution.

Thanks,
John
