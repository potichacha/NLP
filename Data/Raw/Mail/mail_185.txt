Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent scaling issues with our cloud resources managed by Aetheros.  Specifically, our application struggles to handle traffic spikes effectively, leading to slowdowns and even outages.  

Could you please advise on how to troubleshoot this issue?

Best,
