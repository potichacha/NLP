Hi Aetheros Support,

We are facing a critical issue with deploying our Mercury application on AWS using Aetheros Cloud Management. The deployment process is failing consistently, and we are seeing errors related to resource provisioning. 

We are on a tight deadline and this is severely impacting our operations. Could you please look into this urgently?

Here are the details:
- Aetheros Account ID: 857-329-541
- Application Name: phoenix-app
- Error Message: "Resource limit exceeded for instance type"

We have tried adjusting resource limits in our AWS console, but the issue persists. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
John Doe
