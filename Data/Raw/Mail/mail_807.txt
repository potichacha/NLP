Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing a critical issue with IAM role assignment.  We can't assign the necessary permissions to our new DevOps engineer, which is blocking our deployment process entirely.

We've tried reassigning the role, but we're still encountering the same error.  We need this resolved ASAP as it's impacting our production environment.

Please advise on how to proceed.

Thanks,
John Doe
