{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To create a webpage displaying a clock in the center that shows the time of day calculated as a percentage of the 24-hour time, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's an example code: HTML: CSS: JavaScript: The  startTime()  function gets the current time, calculates the percentage of the 24-hour time, and displays it in the  #time  element. The  checkTime()  function adds a leading zero to the hours, minutes, and seconds if they are less than 10. You can save the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate files named  index.html ,  style.css , and  script.js , respectively, in the same folder. Then, you can open the  index.html  file in a web browser to view the clock."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! Here's an example of how you can update the CSS to make the digital clock display more beautiful, using emojis and matching colors: CSS: In this CSS code, we changed the background color to a darker shade of blue (#2c3e50), which matches the white color of the digital clock. We also added a text shadow effect to the  #time  element to give it a more 3D-like effect. We also added two new elements,  #sun  and  #percent , which will display a sun emoji and the percent value, respectively. We set the font size of the  #sun  and  #percent  elements to 2rem, and we added a margin of 0.5rem between them and the  #time  element. HTML: In the HTML code, we added the  #sun  and  #percent  elements inside the  #time  element. JavaScript: In the JavaScript code, we modified the  updateClock()  function to only update the  #percent  element with the percent value.
