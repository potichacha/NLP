{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'In the play The Tempest by William Shakespeare, the lines spoken by Ariel that begin with "All hail, great master!" are: Act 1, Scene 2: "All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure; be \'t to fly, To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curl\'d clouds; to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality." Act 1, Scene 2: "All hail, great master! Gratia curiam, lovesome, powerful; it shall skip, from here, And drop on this island." Act 3, Scene 3: "All hail, great master! Grave sir, hail! I come To answer thy best pleasure." These lines show Ariel\'s loyalty and subservience to his master, the magician Prospero. They also highlight Ariel\'s magical abilities and willingness to carry out Prospero\'s commands, no matter how difficult or dangerous they may be.'}

Here\'s the continuation of Ariel\'s speech in Act 1, Scene 2 of The Tempest: "Happily may I through me the full blue sky, In safely after oar again see on the wing; Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.

Merrily, merrily, shall I live now, Under the blossom that hangs on the bough." This passage showcases Ariel\'s poetic and musical abilities, as well as his willingness to serve and obey Prospero.
