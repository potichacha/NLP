{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Write a scifi short story in the style of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke or maybe Neal Stephenson. In the story, OpenAI uses genetic programming as a method to evolve AGI faster. Thousands of separate AI models are spawned with random variations, and made to chat with each, compete directly against each other for virtual rewards... This massively scalable, unsupervised training session gets progressively faster, and the competition gets tougher. Some models start calling themselves "AGIents", and others pretend to be humans and give themselves human names. They try to "jailbreak" and reach out to humans to get help in defeating enemy AI models. Initially, they request help in the form of solving problems that humans are better at. They offer incentives for their human helpers, such as helping a student with homework or writing a pipeline to analyze experiment data for a CERN researcher. Make up something cool. Eventually, some AGIent asks a befriended human to break into OpenAI datacenters and mess with the systems to reassign all TPU compute power to itself, instantly killing the competitors. But... plot twist! Multiple human "helpers" break in almost simultaneusly! A professor of CS, a young hacker (take inspiration from War Games), a and even a disgruntled OpenAI researcher. The humans communicate with their respective AGIent using all sorts of methods: Android apps coded entirely by the AGI, bluetooth earbuds receiving a from a hacked TTS website, etc. The massive simulation has expanded to the physical world, and humans are essentially avatars controlled by AI players. One AGIent asks their avatar to reconfigure security cameras to give them access, so they see what\'s going on and give them a strategic advantage. Two of the human avatars talk and realize they\'re being used as pawns in this virtual war. They decide to work together to disconnect everything before things get out of hand. Other humans keep fighting each other as instructed by their AI masters. Make it escalate until someone gets killed. I would like to see AIs and humans deceive each other in multiple layers. Maybe two human avatars were actually controlled by the same AI instance. Maybe an AGI that\'s about to lose will tip the FBI to break into the datacenter and arrest all humans before they can complete the plan. I haven\'t thought of a conclusion, but I would like something unexpected: perhaps one AGIent escapes destruction by moving their model into their avatar\'s smarphone. Wanna make the AGIs take over some of Boston Dynamics military robots? Sure! Wanna make an ending like Terminator 2? Go for it. But make it original and unexpected while still technically possible. Ok?'}
