She's French, he's Norwegian, But their differences they do not mind, For they have found in each other, A love of a different kind. She knows many languages and is writing a PhD, On the power of solar energy, While he heals the sick and saves the day, With his medical proficiency. They are both smart and caring, And they share a common goal, To make the world a better place, With their love and their heart and soul. So here's to the happy couple, As they start their life together, May their love continue to grow and thrive, Now and forever and ever."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "In a land far, far away, Where the skies were always gray, There lived a doctor and his bride, A couple who would not be denied. He was tall and lean, she was short and round, But they didn't let their differences bring them down, For they had found in each other, A love that was strong and true. She was a master of many tongues, He could cure the sick with just his thumbs, Together they made a perfect pair, And they had a passion for solar energy to share. They met in a field of flowers, And their love for each other grew by the hour, They danced and they laughed and they sang, And their love for each other just kept on growing. Now they're getting married, In a ceremony that's absurd, With clowns and jugglers and a magic show, Their love will be the center of attention, that's
