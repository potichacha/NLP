We want to be able to use the existing EIPs with minimal code changes as code changes could need to be venerability and attack. How do you think we should build this out?'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "As a tokenomics expert, I recommend building your betting platform using Ethereum smart contracts with a focus on utilizing existing and proven EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) to minimize code changes and ensure security. Here's a step-by-step plan to build the platform: Oracle Integration: To access external data such as Bitcoin's price, you'll need to use a decentralized oracle service like Chainlink or Band Protocol. They provide secure and reliable access to off-chain data for your smart contracts. ERC-20 Token Standard: Consider using the ERC-20 token standard for creating a native token for your platform. This token can be used for placing bets and distributing rewards. Implementing the ERC-20 standard allows compatibility with existing wallets and platforms. Betting Smart Contract: Create a smart contract for managing bets on both sides (pro-Balaji and pro-banks). This contract should include the following functionalities: a. Accepting Bets: Users should be able to deposit your native ERC-20 tokens to bet on either side. The smart contract should store the amount of tokens placed on each side. b. Time Lock: Implement a time lock function to ensure bets can only be placed before the 90-day deadline. c. Bet Resolution: After the 90-day period, the smart contract should use the oracle service to fetch the current Bitcoin price. If the price reaches 1 million dollars, it should declare the pro-Balaji side as the winner, and vice versa. d. Distribution of Rewards: Once the winning side is determined, the smart contract should distribute the pooled tokens proportionally to the winners based on their initial bets. Security and Auditing: As you're concerned about vulnerabilities and potential attacks, it's essential to have your smart contracts audited by a reputable security firm. This ensures that the code is secure and follows best practices. Frontend Development: Develop a user-friendly website that interacts with your smart contracts. Users should be able to connect their Ethereum wallets, place bets using your native token, and view the betting progress. Deployment: Deploy your smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet after thorough testing and auditing. Once deployed, user
