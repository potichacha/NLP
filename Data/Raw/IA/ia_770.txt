{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "We already have html test reports. The info is in a xml and it is formatted with xsl. We also have javascript code in it. All this is old but works as we want, but we want to we want to modernize this. The main reason is that it also uses activex, which is unsafe. It forces us to view the reports in Internet Explorer, which is deprecated, or to use IETab plugin to view them in Chrome. I am looking for ways to modernize it so wevcan use it on Chrome without plugin and without disabling security features. The main reason we use activeX is that we have to access the file system and modify files on it. The test references, which are in tcml files (they are xml in fact, that's just an extension), have to be modified if the developer clicks on an Accept button to accept the new result of a test."}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "It's a great idea to modernize your test reports to make them more secure and accessible across different browsers. Here are some steps to help you achieve this: Convert XML to JSON: Modern web applications typically use JSON for data interchange. You can convert your XML data to JSON using a library like xml2json in JavaScript. This would make it easier to manipulate and work with your data in modern web frameworks. Replace XSL with a modern templating engine: XSL is an older technology, and you could replace it with a more modern templating engine such as Handlebars or Mustache. These libraries make it easy to generate HTML based on JSON data. Replace ActiveX with a web service: To avoid using ActiveX for filesystem access, you can create a web service that performs file operations on the server side. This way, your client-side code sends requests to the server, and the server handles the file modifications. This would also improve security, as you can implement proper authentication and authorization on your web service. Use a modern JavaScript framework: To make your application more maintainable and up-to-date, consider using a modern JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. These frameworks provide a better way to structure your code and make it easier to maintain and update. Replace Internet Explorer-specific code: Make sure to remove any code that is specific to Internet Explorer or relies on its features. Modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge have better support for web standards, and you can use features like Fetch API, CSS Grid, and Flexbox to improve your"}

Implement responsive design: To ensure that your test reports look good on all devices and screen sizes, use a responsive design approach. This can be achieved with CSS media queries, CSS Grid, or Flexbox. Improve accessibility: Make sure your test reports are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by following accessibility best practices such as using semantic HTML,
