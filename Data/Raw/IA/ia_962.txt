{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': '6 / 6I have the following bigquery query:  select substr(cast(ingest_time as string), 0, 16) as timestamp, count(1) as value  FROM \\`full_table_name`  WHERE DATE(event_date) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 DAY)  group by timestamp  order by timestamp desc  limit 30; This query will return no results if there is no data. Change the query to return the data with a zero value if there is no data. The interval should be by the minute.'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To return data with a zero value when there is no data, you can use a cross join with a generated time series of minutes in the specified interval. Here's a modified version of your query: This query generates a series of minute-level timestamps for the past 3 days and left joins it with the original table. If there is no matching data for a particular minute, it returns a zero value."}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "This doesn't work - try again."}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Apologies for the confusion. Let me provide you with an updated query. We'll use a separate subquery to handle the aggregation of the existing data, and then join it with the generated time series of minutes: This query first generates a series of minute-level timestamps for the past 3 days. It then aggregates the existing data in a separate subquery. Finally, the minute_series and aggregated_data are left-joined, and the COALESCE function is used to return a zero value when there is no matching data for a specific minute."}
