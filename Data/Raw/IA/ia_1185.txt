{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "The complete page going black for a split second while transitioning from one page to another in a Next.js app is usually caused by the browser's rendering process. When a user clicks a link or a button that leads to a new page, the browser has to request the new page's content from the server and then render the new page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This process can take some time, and during that time, the browser may display a blank or black screen until the new page's content is fully loaded and ready to be displayed. However, Next.js has a built-in mechanism to prefetch and preload pages, which can help to improve the transition experience by reducing the time it takes to load the new page. You can try enabling the  Link  component's  prefetch  prop to prefetch pages before the user clicks on them. Another possible reason for the complete page going black could be a slow server response time or slow internet connection. In such cases, it may take longer to fetch and render the new page, causing the screen to go black for a longer period. To improve the performance of your app, you can try optimizing your code and assets, reducing the size of your images, and using caching mechanisms to reduce the number of server requests. Additionally, you can use tools such as Google Lighthouse to analyze your app's performance and identify areas for improvement."}
