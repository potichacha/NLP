{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "Sounds fun! Here is our objective today: We have a business where for the past few years we have done custom video work for many different clients. This video work has specifically been mostly for entrepreneurs looking to build their personal brand on social media sites such as instagram, tiktok, linkedin, and youtube. Now we are preparing a new offer where instead of doing a broad range of videos for a broad range of people, we want to niche down to only work with 7 figure+ entrepreneurs who want to build their brand on social media by doing authentic short form videos. These entrepreneurs must be focused on long-term growth, but still have a goal in mind for converting their audience into monetary value. We do an ongoing service of all social media management related to these videos. This includes strategy, posting, hashtags, music, editing, script writing, studio setup, and in some cases even filming in person. The only thing our clients need to do is get in front of a camera and we take care of the rest. So here's our first objective: We need to niche down even further. Currently we are trying to decide if we should try and work with clients who want to leverage their personal brand and audience to convert to sales for their current business (let's call this type of client Ulysses) OR if we should go after clients who are close to exiting their business or have recently exited and are looking to monetize their brand and audience later down the line, perhaps years in the future (we'll call this type of client Luke)  Here are some of the pros for both sides: Ulysses: - We can price lower and have a rev-share component to the offer - It will be easier to point to metrics of success (e.g. more leads, more revenue, more sales, etc.) - Opportunities to add more services to our offer specifically related to managing the new leads generated by the personal brand Luke: - Long-term view means that clients will be more focused on doing things the right way rather than converting their audience immediately - Our personal preferred style of growing a brand aligns better with a long-term approach -- Cons: Ulysses: - Clients won't have a long-term view and it will make us have to change the way we do videos and posting to drive towards leads and sales - Our own personal methodologies don't perfectly align with a short-term view Luke: - Metrics are hard when you don't have a metric-based goal with your personal brand. General goodwill and audience is hard to quantify, making the sales process more difficult - Fewer opportunities
