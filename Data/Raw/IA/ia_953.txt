Test data: test.csv  3. Submission file: sample_submission.csv  The train.csv file consists of 3 columns of id, text and label, and the test.csv file consists of 2 columns of id and text.  The sample_submission.csv file consists of id and label columns second: There are 8 labels in total. The data is news article.  I want to make a model to classify this.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Great, now that I understand the task you want to accomplish, let's move forward. Based on the information you provided, it seems that you are looking to build a model that can accurately classify news articles based on their content. You will be using a training dataset (train.csv) to train the model, and a test dataset (test.csv) to evaluate the model's performance. The training dataset contains three columns: id, text, and label. The id column contains unique identifiers for each article, the text column contains the content of the article, and the label column contains one of eight possible labels that the article
