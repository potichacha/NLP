Start small: Begin with a small goal that you can achieve easily, such as 5-10 minutes of drawing or a short walk each day.

Set a specific time: Choose a specific time of day that works for you to do the activity. It's best to do it at the same time every day, so it becomes a routine that you can stick to. Plan ahead: Make sure you have everything you need to do the activity. For example, if you want to draw daily, make sure you have a sketchbook and pencils ready. Track your progress: Keep track of your progress by taking pictures, keeping a journal, or using a habit-tracking app. Seeing your progress can help motivate you to keep going. Be consistent: Stick to your routine even if you don't feel like it. Consistency is key to developing a habit. Remember, developing a routine takes time and effort, but with persistence, you can make it a part of your daily life. Be patient with yourself, and celebrate
