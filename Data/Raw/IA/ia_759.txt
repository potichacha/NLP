{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To change the background color of an Adaptive Card, you can\'t directly set a property on the card itself, but you can use a container with a custom style as a workaround. You can define a custom style in your host configuration, which you then apply to a container that covers the whole card. Here\'s a step-by-step guide: In this example, the custom style is named "myCustomStyle," and it has a background color of "#FF5733". For Bot Framework WebChat, you can provide the host config while creating the Web Chat: By following these steps, you\'ll have an Adaptive Card with a custom background color. Remember to replace the color value with the desired background color for your card.'}
