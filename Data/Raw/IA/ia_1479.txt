{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'The DOM tree represents a sidebar component of an application, presumably an IntelliJ IDEA documentation page. The sidebar contains a navigation menu with expandable/collapsible sections and clickable links, organized in a hierarchical structure. The sections include topics such as "Getting started", "IDE configuration", "Project configuration", "Write and edit source code", "Compilation and building", "Running", "Debugging", "Deployment", "Testing", "Analysis", "Version control", "Remote development", "Integrated tools", and several programming languages and technologies. The sidebar\'s theme is light, and it has a scrollable container to accommodate the entire list of menu items. The menu items are indented according to their nesting level, with sub-items indented further than their parent items. Some menu items have a small arrow icon (an SVG element), indicating that they are expandable or collapsible sections. The arrow points downward when the section is expanded and upward when it\'s collapsed. Selected and highlighted menu items have different styling, such as bold text or a different background color.'}
