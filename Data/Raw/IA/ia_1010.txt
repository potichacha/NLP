{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to request a review of the decision made by the Clinical School Allocations Appeals Committee regarding my appeal to change clinical schools. While I appreciate the Committee's consideration of my appeal, I am confused about the reasons given for denying my request. My appeal was based on my role as the primary carer for my father, who is immediate family and has no other family members who are able to provide care. I understand that the Clinical School Allocation policy states that care for a family member that is not immediate family and/or where the primary responsibility for that family member lies elsewhere is a non-acceptable reason for appeal. However, my circumstances do not fall within this category, as my father is my immediate family and I bear primary responsibility for his care. I provided sufficient evidence to support my claim, and I believe that my situation falls outside the extensive list of non-acceptable reasons. As such, I respectfully request that the Committee review my case and provide further information regarding how my appeal does not fulfil the requirements of the allocation policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response."}

{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'I am going to request a review of my appeal from the Clinical School Appeals Committee. Please write me a formal cover letter to the committee based on the reasons below: "While I understand that the commute from North Melbourne to Footscray is not overly burdensome, my appeal is not related to this. Currently, I live across the road from Royal Melbourne Hospital with my father, and this allows me to have very quick access to him should I need to help him with basic things. I would be able to temporarily leave placement to return home and assist him when needed. My appeal is not related to my own convenience but rather the duration of time taken to assist from the moment I am called upon. This is time-sensitive, and a 30 minute commute would render me unable to fulfill my carer responsibilities, and would also undermine my ability to undergo placements.
