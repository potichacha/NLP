He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains, and red tie. John Thompson is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. All of the students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him. Carol Yapp is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses."}

Andy is pacing around the room, trying to impress John with an elaborate story about how he presented the school talent show. Andy: "And then, I got up on stage, and I introduced the acts, one by one. I was like a professional emcee, John. I tell ya, I stole the show. The students loved me." John, unimpressed, sips his tea and looks at Andy over the rim of his red-tinted glasses. John: "Is that so, Andy? How long did you spend in the disabled toilets rehearsing your lines?" Andy, caught off guard, stammers. Andy: "Uh, well, I didn\'t exactly rehearse my lines, John. I just have a natural talent for public speaking." John raises an eyebrow and shakes his head. John: "Of course you do, Andy. And I\'m sure the stains on your shirt are just a coincidence." Carol Yapp, the chief exams officer, walks into the staff room and clears her throat to get everyone\'s attention. Carol: "Good morning, everyone. I trust you are all ready for the exams today. Remember, no speaking during the exams, and no unauthorized materials allowed in the testing rooms. Let\'s maintain a professional atmosphere." Andy, still trying to impress John, stands up straight and puffs out his chest. Andy: "Of course, Carol. I\'ll make sure to keep everything in order. After all, I\'m the best Computing teacher this school has ever seen." John rolls his eyes and mutters under his breath. John: "If only that were true."'}
