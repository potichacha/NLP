{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Certainly! Here's a Python program that takes a folder of audio files as input and performs data augmentation on them. I'll use the 'librosa' library for audio processing and 'augmentor' for audio augmentation. Please make sure to install these libraries before running the code: Now, here's the Python code: Replace the paths in the  input_folder  and  output_folder  variables with the paths to your input and output folders, respectively. The program will apply a series of augmentations to the audio files found in the input folder, such as adding Gaussian noise, time stretching, pitch shifting, and random shifting. These augmentations are applied with a 50% probability, so the output files will have a mix of different augmentations applied to them. You can customize the augmentation probabilities, intensity, and types according to your needs. After running this script, you should find the augmented audio files in the specified output folder."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! I've modified the code to split stereo audio files into two mono files before applying the augmentations. The output filenames will include the channel information (e.g.,  file_L.wav  for the left channel and  file_R.wav  for the right channel). This code will load the stereo audio files, split them into two mono channels, and then apply the augmentations to each channel separately. The augmented mono files will be saved in the output folder with the  _L  and  _R  suffixes indicating the left and right channels, respectively."}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Can you add the possibility to enter as arguments from the commandline: the input and output folder and also choose if I want to split stereo files or not?'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! You can use the  argparse  library to parse command-line arguments. I've updated the code to include this functionality: To run the script from the command line, you can use the following command: Replace  <input_folder>  and  <output_folder>  with the paths to your input and output folders, respectively. If you want to split stereo files, include the  --split_stereo  flag. If you don't want to split stereo files, simply omit the  --split_stereo  flag: This updated code allows you to control the input and output folders, as well as the option to split stereo files, via command-line arguments."}
