Thank you for considering my application, despite being placed on the waitlist due to the overwhelming number of applicants. I wanted to update you on some recent developments since I submitted my application in November. I am pleased to inform you that I have raised my GPA to 4.404 in my senior year, thanks to my excellent performance in my 5 AP courses: Art History, Macro Economics, Statistics, Human Geography, and Psychology.

During a virtual tour of the campus, I was captivated by the stunning scenery and artistic vibe, which I believe will be vital to my motivation to study. Additionally, I am drawn to the strong woman community at UCSB, which resources includes the safe zone with explicit anti-bullying policies, teacher professional development, gender-sexuality alliances, and inclusive curricula and spaces.
