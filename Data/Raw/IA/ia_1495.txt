{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "Generate a process: I'm a mock interview coach. I have over 200 hours of footage of my sessions. Inside this footage is the necessary text to create a prompt / response fine-tuning set. But I don't have the time to play all 200 hours in real time into a AI meeting notes app to collect the text transcripts. I'm looking for a process that could be built, which tools to use, so that I have a transcript and can easily feed it into a model for fine-tuning. The end goal is a re-useable training set without typing it all up by hand. Every Q&A a client asked, every 3 minute lesson embedded into a session, All my unique thoughts captured and recorded. To unlock this insight I realize that ChatGPT has the ability to write summaries if I can first submit the text. Open to all ideas and process. You are an expert and designing low-cost systems with your existing knowledge in 2021 tools available.  Process 1: Existing Footage First to extract from existing footage the text and operator will assign a set of pattern categories. Type of question, theory response, lesson response, exercise, student answer, coach prompt, etc. These tags can be later used by the coach to collect a large volume of fine-tuning prompts for any Language Learning Model.  Process 2: New Client Recordings in the future  Generate a functional procedure to automatically transcribe the meeting. Then categorize the conversation chunks into new fine-tuning prompts and existing prompts. Then submit the text into the fine-tuning repository for future fine-tuning exercises that continue to improve the model version."}

{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Google sheets has created a plugin for Open.AI GPT model so I can perform this step in google sheets easily.  Once the formula in the worksheet performs an AI response to a prompt, I can then edit with my own coach version. Editing for the coach is easier than generating these lists from nothing. So the process starts with the text blocks (A) creates a first draft with AI (B) then the operator corrects the responses to be more like the coaches in another column (C) . Finally, column C would be submitted with the original text from A into the repository for later reuse training the model.  Update the first process to show this modification.'}
