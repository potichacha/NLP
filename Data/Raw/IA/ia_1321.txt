{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To get all postal codes and their street names for Germany from OpenStreetMap, you can use the Overpass API, which allows you to query and extract data from the OpenStreetMap database.

For more advanced options and filtering, you can refer to the Overpass QL documentation at  ."}
