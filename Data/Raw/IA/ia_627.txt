Born on July 30, 1863, in a small farming community in Dearborn, Michigan, Ford was the eldest of six children to parents William and Mary Ford. He grew up in a close-knit family that valued hard work, innovation, and self-reliance. From an early age, Ford showed a keen interest in machines and mechanics. At the age of 16, he left home to work as an apprentice machinist at a shipbuilding firm in Detroit. After completing his apprenticeship, he continued to work in various machine shops and factories, eventually returning to his family\'s farm in 1882. While working on the farm, Ford became fascinated with the potential of the internal combustion engine. He was particularly interested in applying this technology to create a horseless carriage, which could revolutionize transportation. In 1891, Ford joined the Edison Illuminating Company in Detroit as an engineer, where he met Thomas Edison, who became a mentor and friend to him. Ford built his first gasoline-powered horseless carriage, the Quadricycle, in 1896. Encouraged by Edison, he continued to experiment with automotive designs and established the Detroit Automobile Company in 1899. However, the company failed due to the high cost and low quality of the cars it produced. Undeterred, Ford continued his work and in 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T, an affordable, durable, and easy-to-drive car. The Model T revolutionized the automotive industry and transformed American society by making automobile ownership accessible to the masses. To meet the high demand for the Model T, Ford pioneered the assembly line production method, which significantly reduced manufacturing time and costs. This innovation led to the development of mass production techniques, which in turn enabled Ford to lower the prices of his cars and pay his workers a higher wage, known as the "Five-Dollar Day." The combination of affordable cars and good wages helped create a thriving middle class in the United States. Ford\'s influence extended beyond the automotive industry. He was an early advocate for the use of soybeans in industrial applications, investing in research and development of soy-based plastics, fuels, and other products. He also supported education and healthcare initiatives in his community. However, Ford\'s life was not without controversy. He held anti-Semitic views and published a series of articles in his newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, promoting conspiracy theories about Jewish people. These articles were later compiled and published as a book called "The International Jew." Ford\'s anti-Semitic beliefs have tarnished his legacy, despite his significant contributions to industry and innovation. Henry Ford passed away on April 7, 1947, leaving behind a legacy of innovatio
