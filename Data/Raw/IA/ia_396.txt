{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "I want to develop a frontend that will show slides - currently, I'm thinking `reveal.js` on top of `React`, because I've tried `Spectacle.js` and couldn't get it to dynamically produce slides. The general functionality is as follows: 1. The visitor enters at `/adk-wrapped/[person_id]` where `person_id` is their unique identifier in the database. 2. The frontend calls on the backend API (already written) at `/achievements/[person_id]`. 3. The API will return an array of JSON dicts with at least the following keys: `achievement_id`, `achievement_name` (the heading), `achievement_description` (the text). 4. The frontend will render the slides in between two static slides: an introduction slide and a conclusion slide. These slides should be written in Reveal.js. Write the required frontend code in full, indicating which code should go in which file. Include any setup steps if needed."}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To achieve your desired functionality, you'll need to set up a new React project, install necessary packages, and create the appropriate components. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do that: Now, you should have a working frontend app that fetches achievements for a person and displays them as slides using Reveal.js. Make sure to replace the  personId  constant in  src/App.tsx  with the actual person_id from the URL path. To do this, you can use a router like  react-router  or get the person_id from the URL directly using  window.location.pathname ."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To use  react-router , you need to install the necessary packages and then modify the  src/App.tsx  file to include routing configuration. Here's how to do it: The  SlidesRoute  component is used to extract the  person_id  from the URL using  useParams  and pass it as a prop to the  Slides  component. The  Route  component inside the  Switch  component is responsible for rendering the  SlidesRoute  component when the URL matches the path  /adk-wrapped/:person_id . Now your app will use  react-router  to handle routing and pass the  person_id  from the URL to the  Slides  component."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Apologies for the confusion. If you're using JavaScript instead of TypeScript, you can still follow the same approach with slight modifications to the code. Here's the updated code for JavaScript: Make sure to update the other components as well: The main difference between JavaScript and TypeScript files is the usage of types and interfaces. In JavaScript, you don't need to specify types, and you can remove type annotations and interface declarations from the code."}
