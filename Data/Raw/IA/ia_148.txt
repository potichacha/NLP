{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'The sum of 6 consecutive integers can be represented as: (n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) + (n + 4) + (n + 5)) Expanding and simplifying this expression, we get: 6n + 15 Since 6 is divisible by 3, and 3 is a factor of 15, we can conclude that 6n + 15 is divisible by 3. Also, since 6 is even, it is divisible by 2. Therefore, 6n + 15 is also divisible by 2, and as a result, it is divisible by 4. So, the sum of 6 consecutive integers is divisible by 4.'}
