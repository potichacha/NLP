I want to store all data as a write-once log. when we load the dashboard it should show the current balance. My child gets 3 allowances per week, one for spending, one for savings, and one for giving. I also want to be able to change the weekly amount and have it only reflected in future allowances."}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To create a Ruby on Rails program for tracking your kid's allowance, you'll need to follow these steps: Here's a rough outline of the models, controllers, and actions needed for this application: Step 1: Create a new Rails project Step 2: Generate the AllowanceEvent model Step 3: Update the AllowanceEvent model ( app/models/allowance_event.rb ) Step 4: Create the migrations Step 5: Generate the Dashboard controller and views Step 6: Generate the AllowanceEvents controller and views Step 7: Generate the Settings controller and views Step 8: Implement the controllers and views as per the application logic. Once you've implemented the controllers and views, your Ruby on Rails program should be ready to track your kid's allowance as a write-once log, show the current balance on the dashboard, and allow you to change the weekly allowance for future records."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "The  app/views/dashboard/index.html.erb  file should contain the HTML and embedded Ruby code to display the current balance for spending, savings, and giving, as well as any relevant navigation links. Here's a simple example: This example assumes that the  DashboardController 's  index  action calculates the current balance for each category (spending, savings, and giving) and stores it in instance variables ( @spending_balance ,  @savings_balance , and  @giving_balance ). These instance variables are then used to display the balance in the view. Additionally, the view includes a link to the 'Update Weekly Allowance' page, which allows you to edit the weekly allowance settings. Remember to update your  DashboardController 's  index  action to calculate the balances and set the instance variables accordingly."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure, here's the code for the  DashboardController 's  index  action to calculate the balances for spending, savings, and giving. Update your  app/controllers/dashboard_controller.rb  file with the following code: This code calculates the balance for each category by fetching all allowance events of the given category and summing up their amounts. The  calculate_balance  method is a private helper method that takes a category as an argument and returns the balance for that category. Keep in mind that this is a simple example and may not cover all edge cases, such as handling different types of events (e.g., updating the weekl
