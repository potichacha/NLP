{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "It can sometimes be challenging to determine whether someone is telling a story or making a claim, especially in casual conversation or when context is limited. However, there are some clues you can look for to help make this distinction: Intent: Try to understand the speaker's intent. Are they trying to entertain, teach, or persuade? Storytelling often has an element of entertainment, while making a claim is usually about presenting a fact or an opinion. Structure: Stories typically have a clear beginning, middle, and end, and often involve characters, a setting, and a plot. Claims, on the other hand, are usually presented as statements or assertions. Language: Pay attention to the words used by the speaker. Storytelling often involves descriptive language, vivid imagery, and dialogue, while claims are likely to be more direct, concise, and objective. Tone: Listen to the speaker's tone. Storytelling can be more engaging, emotive, and expressive, while making a claim can sound more matter-of-fact or authoritative. Evidence: Claims are usually supported by evidence, such as data, research, or expert opinions. If the speaker provides evidence to back up their statement, it's more likely they're making a claim. Subject matter: Topics like personal experiences, cultural events, or anecdotes are more likely to be presented in story form. In contrast, topics like scientific findings, political opinions, or factual information often take the form of claims. Context: Consider the context of the conversation. If the speaker is responding to a question, they might be more likely to make a claim. If they are sharing an experience or trying to connect with the audience, they might be more likely to tell a story. Remember that sometimes, people may blend storytelling and making claims, so it's essential to analyze the entire context to determine the speaker's intent."}

Each clip extraction must be 2-5 minutes long so as to have enough context to be significant to the whole story. Provide 9 clips. Use the following format: put the above text into a table of 7 columns: - outlandish claim - the overview (eg Thought of being a lawyer and then switched to business) - start timestamp minute (eg 19:30) - start timestamp seconds (eg 1170) - end timestamp minute (eg 20:31) - end timestamp seconds (eg 1231) - clip (eg At one point, I thought I was going to be a lawyer and then I majored in chemistry for the first year, but realized it wasn\'t for me due to difficulties with lab work. Since then, I decided to go into business and ended up there.) Do you understand? Transcript:  Here is the transcript that you are to extract stories and claims from:
