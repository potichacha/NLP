{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To show a new screen with a back button in Flutter, you can use the  Navigator  widget. Here's an example: When the button is pressed, it will push the  NewScreen  onto the navigation stack, which will automatically add a back button to the  AppBar  in the new screen. This back button will allow the user to go back to the previous screen."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'If you want to add a custom "Return" or "Back" button to the  AppBar  of the new screen, you can do so by setting the  leading  property of the  AppBar  to a widget that represents the button. Here\'s an updated example that includes a custom "Back" button in the  AppBar : In this example, we\'ve added an  IconButton  to the  leading  property of the  AppBar . The icon used is the back arrow icon provided by Flutter\'s  Icons  class. When the button is pressed, we call  Navigator.of(context).pop()  to pop the current screen off the navigation stack and return to the previous screen.'}
