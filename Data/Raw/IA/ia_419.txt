{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To download a large file from S3 using multiple concurrent range requests in Node.js, you can use the AWS SDK and the 'async' library to manage concurrent requests. Here's an example program to achieve this: Replace  <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID> ,  <YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> ,  <YOUR_REGION> ,  <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME> ,  <YOUR_OBJECT_KEY> , and  <YOUR_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH>  with your own values. Run the program: This program will download a large file from an S3 bucket using multiple concurrent range requests and save it to the specified output file. The  concurrencyLimit  and  chunkSize  values can be adjusted to suit your needs."}
