{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "If you were born blind and have never seen a whale, here is some information that may help you understand what a whale looks like: Whales are giant marine mammals that live in the ocean. They have a streamlined body, which is very large and can be up to 100 feet long, depending on the species. They are usually gray or black in color, but some species have distinct patterns or markings. Whales have a large head, which is often covered in bumps and ridges, and a powerful tail, which they use to swim through the water. Whales are known for their distinctive sounds, which they use to communicate with each other. They also have a blowhole on top of their head, which they use to breathe air when they come to the surface. Moby Dick, the whale in the novel, is described as a large and aggressive white whale, which is much larger than any other whale. It's important to note that this is a fictional character, and real-life whales come in many different shapes, sizes, and colors."}
