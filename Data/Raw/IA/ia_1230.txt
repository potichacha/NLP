{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To perform this task in Excel, you\'ll need to use a combination of built-in functions and some custom code using the "WEBSERVICE" function and a custom function created in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to extract the contents of the first <span> tag. Please note that using WEBSERVICE function might not work in some versions of Excel, such as Excel for Mac or Excel for Office 365. Here\'s how to achieve this: Press  ALT + F11  to open the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor. Then, click  Insert  >  Module  to create a new module. Paste the following code into the module: Close the VBA editor by clicking the "X" in the upper-right corner or pressing  ALT + Q . In cell B2, enter the following formula: Now, when you enter a column ID in cell A2, Excel will fetch the HTML content from the specified URL and the custom function will extract the content of the first <span> tag, displaying it in cell B2. Please note that the WEBSERVICE function has some limitations, and you might encounter issues with it in certain scenarios. In such cases, you might need to consider using a more advanced method like a custom VBA function to make web requests.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Unfortunately, Excel does not have a built-in function to parse HTML content directly without using VBA or macros. However, you can try using a workaround with the WEBSERVICE and FILTERXML functions, although this method might not be as robust. In Excel, let's say you want to display the result in cell B2, and the column ID is in cell A2. In cell B2, enter the following formula: This formula uses the WEBSERVICE function to fetch the HTML content from the specified URL, and then FILTERXML function attempts to extract the content of the first <span> tag. However, please note that this method may not work reliably in all cases, as the FILTERXML function is designed to work with well-formed XML documents, and HTML content might not be well-formed XML. If the HTML content is not well-formed, you may encounter errors or incorrect results. In cases where this method does not work, you may need to use a custom VBA function or consider using other tools like Power Query, which provides more advanced web scraping capabilities."}
