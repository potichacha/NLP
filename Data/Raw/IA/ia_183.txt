It\'s a strange feeling, but think about it: when we dream, our minds create an entire world, complete with people, places, and events that seem to happen in real-time. And when we wake up, we\'re suddenly back in our own reality, with no memory of how we got there. In a way, every time we wake up from a dream, we\'re experiencing the most realistic version of time travel possible. Our brains have transported us to a completely different reality, where we can interact with people and things that we\'ve never seen before. And then, just as suddenly, we\'re back in our own reality, as if no time has passed at all. It\'s a strange and fascinating experience, and one that we take for granted every day. So the next time you wake up from a dream, take a moment to appreciate the incredible power of your own mind, and the amazing things it can do. After all, who needs a time machine when you have a brain that can create entire worlds?'}
