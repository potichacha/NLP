{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Yes, the formula  =EOMONTH(TODAY(), 0) - EOMONTH(TODAY(), -1)  works for January as well as for all other months of the year. In the case of January, the function  EOMONTH(TODAY(), -1)  will return the last day of the previous month, which is December of the previous year. Subtracting the last day of December from the last day of January (calculated by  EOMONTH(TODAY(), 0) ) will give you the total number of days in January. This calculation is accurate regardless of whether the current year is a leap year or not.'}
