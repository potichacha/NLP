Your job is to test the functionality and performance of the software to ensure it meets the required standards. Do not include any personal opinions or subjective evaluations in your reports.  Here is a DOM tree of a react component. Your first task is to describe how it looks like and how it behave from a user perspective. Please ignore the content and internal implementation details.'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'From a user perspective, the given DOM tree represents a dark-themed navigation sidebar with a table of contents (toc) for a website or application. The sidebar contains a hierarchical structure of sections and subsections with links to different pages. Each section has different levels of indentation, with subsections indented more than their parent sections. The table of contents contains multiple entries such as "Getting started", "Accessibility", "IntelliJ IDEA overview", "User interface", "Pro tips", and many more. Some entries have expandable/collapsible triangles, indicating that there are sub-items within the section. The selected entry is highlighted differently, making it visually distinct from other entries in the table of contents. As a user interacts with the sidebar, they can click on entries to navigate to different sections of the content. They can also click on the expandable/collapsible triangles to reveal or hide subsections within a particular section. The highlighting of the currently selected entry will update as the user navigates through the content.'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': '3 / 3Your next task is to write a set of functional test cases for this component, which would allow performing complete regression testing of the component.'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Test Case 1: Verify the navigation menu is visible and functional Test Case 2: Verify the expand/collapse functionality of menu items with child items Test Case 3: Verify the highlighting of the currently selected menu item Test Case 4: Verify the menu item padding based on nesting level Test Case 5: Verify that the menu items are scrollable Test Case 6: Verify the menu behavior on different browser window sizes Test Case 7: Verify the menu behavior in different browsers Test Case 8: Verify keyboard navigation Test Case 9: Verify the component is accessible'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': '4 / 4Is this a sufficient set of test cases, or are more needed? Please strictly rely on the DOM tree above.'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'The provided set of test cases is relatively comprehensive, given the DOM tree above. However, there are a few additional test cases that can be included to further enhance the testing scope: Test Case 10: Verify the ARIA attributes Test Case 11: Verify the menu item icons are visible and have correct CSS properties Test Case 12: Verify the expand/collapse icon rotation upon click Te
