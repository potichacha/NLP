Let's name this directory `schema` I have a directory of migrations this tool would * understand the current state of the migrations * be able to read the sql files in my directory `schema` * calculate the difference between migrations and files in `schema` * generate a migration including the sql statement needed to alter, create or drop tables. In python, `alembic` does something like this. I'm looking for something similar just in go."}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Yes, there are several libraries in Go that can generate migrations for you. Here are some popular ones: Goose - Goose is a database migration tool written in Go. It supports MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, and Cassandra databases. Goose provides a command-line interface to create, manage, and apply database schema migrations. You can use it to generate migration files based on changes to your schema directory. gormigrate - gormigrate is a database migration library for GORM, a popular Go ORM. It supports SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases. You can use it to generate migration files based on changes to your schema directory. migrate - Migrate is a database migration library that supports SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases.

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure, here's an example of using Goose to generate migration statements based on existing migrations and SQL DDL files: Assuming you have installed Goose, you can create a new migration using the  create  command. For example, to create a new migration named  add_users_table  for a PostgreSQL database, you can run: This will create a new migration file under the  migrations  directory with a name like  20230326190120_add_users_table.sql . Next, you can modify the SQL DDL files under the  schema  directory to add or modify tables and columns. For example, you can add a new  users  table with columns  id ,  name , and  email . Once you have made changes to your schema, you can generate migration statements using the  status  and  sql  commands. For example, to generate a migration file that adds the  users  table, you can run: This will display the current migration status of your database and show the new migration that needs to be applied. In this case, it will show that the  add_users_table  migration is pending. To generate the S
