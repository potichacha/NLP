{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "As an AI company launching a highly sought-after plug-in, we recognize the importance of carefully selecting the first cohort of companies to gain access. In order to ensure a smooth and efficient rollout, we will evaluate companies based on the following criteria: Industry Relevance: We will prioritize companies operating in industries that are most likely to benefit from our AI plug-in, as they will have a higher potential for success and positive impact. Industries such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and marketing will be given higher priority. Company Size: To maximize the impact of our AI plug-in, we will prioritize larger companies that have the resources and infrastructure to implement the plug-in on a larger scale. This will allow us to gather more data and feedback to refine our product. Technical Readiness: We will evaluate each company's technical infrastructure, IT staff capabilities, and their experience with AI and machine learning technologies. Companies with a solid technical foundation and experience in AI will be prioritized, as they will be more likely to successfully integrate our plug-in.

To grade proposals, we will use a weighted scoring system based on the criteria mentioned above. Each criterion will be assigned a weight based on its importance to our goals and objectives. Companies will be graded on a scale of 1-10 for each criterion, and the final score will be calculated by summing the weighted scores. The top-scoring companies will be invited to join our first cohort, giving them priority access to our AI plug-in, documentation, and support resources. This approach will ensure that we provide access to the most relevant, capable,
