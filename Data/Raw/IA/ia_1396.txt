{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Yes, I can help you write a GitHub CI job that uses the ChatGPT API to review the diff of a pull request. Here's an example of how you can do it using Python and the requests library: This workflow uses the  requests  library to make a POST request to the ChatGPT API with the contents of each file changed in the pull request. It then parses the response to get the review and posts it as a comment on the pull request. You'll need to set up a ChatGPT API key and a GitHub token with access to the repository to use this workflow. You can store these secrets as encrypted secrets in your repository's settings and access them using the  ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}  syntax in your workflow."}
