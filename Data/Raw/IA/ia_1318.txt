{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'In academic papers in computer science, it is important to use precise and formal language to convey your research accurately. Instead of saying "we are going to test this and see how it turns out," you could use the following alternatives: Remember to use language that accurately conveys your research intentions and is appropriate for an academic audience.'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'imagine I want to investigate a problem from a different prospective. For example, APT and intrusion detection solutions are all focused on finding and detecting an attack without giving enough consideration to explainability of the detection and the resulted false postives. Mind you, state of the art solutions are good at detecting APTs but do no give enough effort to reduce false postivies or explain the reason of flagging an event. Assume I want to investigate the problem of detection but with focus on explainability and reducing false postives. Write me a research question and a problem scope for the research proposal'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Research Question: How can we develop an intrusion detection system that prioritizes explainability and reduces false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy in the context of APT attacks? Problem Scope: The goal of this research proposal is to investigate the problem of APT detection by developing a novel approach that emphasizes the importance of explainability and reducing false positives. The scope of the proposed research includes the following: A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in APT detection systems and their limitations in terms of explainability and false positives. The development of a novel approach that prioritizes explainability and reduces false positives while maintaining high detection accuracy. Evaluation of the proposed approach using a benchmark dataset and comparison with existing APT detection systems in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and false positive reduction. The exploration of possible improvements and extensions to the proposed approach based on the results of the evaluation. The research proposal aims to contribute to the development of intrusion detection systems that are more effective in detecting APT attacks while providing more transparency and reducing the risk of false positives.'}
