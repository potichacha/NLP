{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To set up Google Workspace with a custom domain so that email goes through Gmail but website requests in a browser go to your separate webhost, you'll need to follow these steps: Sign up for Google Workspace: Go to the Google Workspace website and sign up for an account. During the sign-up process, you'll be asked to enter your domain name. Verify your domain ownership: Google will ask you to verify your domain ownership by adding a TXT record or HTML file to your domain's DNS settings. Follow the instructions provided by Google to complete the verification process. Set up email routing: Once your domain ownership has been verified, you'll need to set up email routing so that incoming email is directed to Gmail. You can do this by creating MX records in your domain's DNS settings. Set up Gmail: Go to the Google Workspace Admin console and set up your Gmail account. You'll need to create user accounts for each person who will be using Gmail, and you may also want to customize settings such as filters, forwarding, and signatures. Set up your webhost: Finally, you'll need to set up your webhost so that requests for your website are directed to your webhost and not to Gmail. This will involve creating an A record in your domain's DNS settings that points to your webhost's IP address. Note that the exact steps for setting up Google Workspace and your webhost may vary depending on your specific situation, so be sure to consult the documentation provided by Google and your webhost for more detailed instructions."}
