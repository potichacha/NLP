{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Sure, here\'s an example of a React component that uses the react-dropbox package to handle file uploads, and then uploads the files to an Azure storage account container using the Azure Blob Storage SDK. It then uses a server-side API to parse the FCS headers and return a card grid with the file names and the parsed FCS header key values as a list. In this example, we\'re using axios to make a POST request to a server-side API at "/api/parse-fcs-headers" with an array of file names as the payload. You would need to implement this API yourself to handle the FCS file parsing and return the parsed header data. The parsed FCS headers are then used to populate the card grid with a card for each file, where the card header is the file name and the card body is a list of the parsed header key-value pairs.'}
