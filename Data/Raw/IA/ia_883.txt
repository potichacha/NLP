{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'It seems that the variable  NextRow  is not being initialized correctly. Instead of finding the last used row in column B, the code is assuming that the first empty row is the next available row. To fix this issue, you can modify the code to find the last used row in column B, and add 1 to get the next available row. You can replace the following code: with: This will set  NextRow  to the next available row in column B of the  DestWS  worksheet. Alternatively, if you want to start printing the results from the first available cell in column B, you can modify the above code to: This code finds the last used row in column B, adds 1 to get the next available row, and makes sure that the  NextRow  value is at least 2 (i.e., the row right after the header row).'}
