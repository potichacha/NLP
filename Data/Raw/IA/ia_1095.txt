{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To plot the information in a map, you can follow the steps below: First, you need to geocode the cities in your dataset to get their latitude and longitude values. Geocoding is the process of converting an address into a latitude and longitude pair. You can use geocoding APIs like Google Maps API or OpenCage Geocoder API to geocode your cities. Once you have the latitude and longitude values for your cities, you can create a new dataset with the following columns: City, Latitude, Longitude, Date, and Number of Outward Flights. You can use a mapping library like Folium or Plotly to plot the data on a map. These libraries allow you to create interactive maps that can be customized to show different data. To create the map, you can group the data by date and city and aggregate the number of outward flights for each group. Then, you can plot the data on the map using markers or choropleth maps. Here's some example code using Folium library: This code creates a map with markers for each city on each date, where the marker size represents the number of outward flights. You can customize the marker icon, color, and popup content to suit your needs."}
