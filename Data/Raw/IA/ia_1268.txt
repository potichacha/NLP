{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'I am using the a version of the "snowflake method" to write a novel. I have the first few steps completed as shown below: Step 1: One-Sentence Summary A mysterious mirror shows viewers an alternate future where a tragedy or loss never occurred, but the obsession with this future takes a toll on their present relationships and well-being. Step 2: One-Paragraph Summary The Mirror\'s Reflection is a story about a mirror that shows viewers an alternate future, one where a tragedy or loss never occurred. Passed down through the centuries, the mirror finds its way into the hands of several characters, each becoming enamored with the alternate reality it shows them. But as they become more and more consumed with this alternate future, it takes a toll on their present relationships and overall well-being. The story follows a series of characters who come into contact with the mirror, including a teenager struggling to balance his present life with his desire for the alternate future, a grieving mother who becomes isolated and fixated on the mirror, and an elderly man who finds solace in the mirror\'s alternate reality. Ultimately, the characters must confront the mirror\'s power and break free from its grip in order to live in the present and find peace. Step 3: Write the Characters Jack - A teenager who becomes obsessed with the mirror\'s alternate future, leading him to become isolated from his friends and family. Sarah - A married woman who lost her child and becomes consumed by the mirror\'s alternate future, straining her relationship with her husband. George - An elderly man who inherited the mirror after losing his wife. He becomes fixated on the alternate future the mirror shows him, leading to strained relationships with his children. Jack\'s best friend - Tries to help Jack break free from the mirror\'s grip. Sarah\'s husband - Attempts to intervene and help his wife, but is unable to break her fixation on the mirror. Sarah\'s therapist - Helps Sarah work through her grief and addiction to the mirror. George\'s son - Tries to intervene and help his father, but is met with resistance and anger. George\'s daughter - Helps her father let go of his obsession with the mirror and move on with his life. Katherine - George\'s daughter, who inherits the mirror at the end of the story. George\'s wife - Appears in the mirror\'s alternate reality, drawing George deeper into his obsession with it.  Step 4 of the Snowflake Method involves expanding the one-sentence summary into a full paragraph. This paragraph should cover the entirety of the story and give a clear idea of the plot, the characters, and the overarching themes. It should be around 5-6 sentences long and should provide a more detailed overview of the story than the one-sentence summary. Here\'s an example paragraph based on our previous work: The Mirror\'s Reflection is a story about a mysterious mirror that shows the viewer an alternate future where a tragedy
