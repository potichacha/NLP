On the surface, KO appeared to be an ordinary OLED salesman, working for the prestigious company, Luminescent Dreams Inc. Little did people know, KO was also a kung fu master, guarding the city against nefarious foes that lurked in the shadows of the night. KO\'s journey began when he was just a child. Orphaned at a young age, he was taken in by a reclusive kung fu master named Shifu Hikari. Under the watchful eye of Shifu Hikari, KO learned the ancient art of kung fu, quickly mastering various forms and techniques. He became adept at harnessing his chi, which granted him the ability to manipulate light. He used this unique skill to enhance his martial arts prowess, earning him the title of the OLED Warrior.
