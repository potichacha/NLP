Type "regedit" and press Enter to open the Registry Editor. Navigate to the following key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced Right-click on the right-hand side of the window and select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value. Name the new value "ShowSecondsInSystemClock" and press Enter. Double-click on the newly created value and set the value data to "1". Click OK to save the changes.
