OF ATHENS Timon , a lord of Athens , in the enjoyment of a princely fortune , affected a humor of liberality which knew no limits . His almost infinite wealth could not flow in so fast but he poured it out faster upon all sorts and degrees of people . Not the poor only tasted of his bounty , but great lords did not disdain to rank themselves among his dependents and followers . His table was resorted to by all the luxurious feasters , and his house was open to all comers and goers at Athens .
