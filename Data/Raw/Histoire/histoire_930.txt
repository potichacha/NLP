lived solitary in the manner of a beast , eating the wild roots and drinking water , flying from the face of his kind , and choosing rather to herd with wild beasts , as more harmless and friendly than man . What a change from Lord Timon the rich , Lord Timon the delight of mankind , to Timon the naked , Timon the man-hater ! Where were his flatterers now ? Where were his attendants and retinue ? Would the bleak air , that boisterous servitor , be his chamberlain , to put his shirt on warm ?
