The Naked Truth; in an ESSAY
upon TRADE.Humbly offered to the Parliament.IT was said of Old, and grounded upon good Reason,
That England was a mighty Animal that would never die, un∣less
it destroy it self; and nothing is consider'd with greater
regret and reluctancy, than the fall of that Person who
was his own Executioner. How far too many of our own Sub∣jects
are at present engaged against the true Interest of their
Native Mother, carried on in a necessitous pursuit of Prefer∣ment
on the one Hand, and sinister and private Gain on the
other, is lamentable to consider, whilst both are but serving
a Foreign Interest, and nothing can attend the success of either
Party but falling into the Hands of the Common Enemy.
Providence hath been miraculously prospicious unto us in our
happy Revolution, thereby enabling us by a frequent Meeting
of our Great Council (which Blessing was denied us in our
two last Reigns) to establish the Interest of England once more
upon its true Basis, by discouraging that course of Trade
which exhausted our Bullion to support our Pride and Luxury,
and by making up those Mounds which were carefully erected
by our Ancestors to secure the Merchandize of our Native
Commodities, to our own Subjects; which were suffered to be
pull'd down in our last Reigns only to enslave us, Poverty be∣ing
the proper Shoo-horn to Slavery; Pride and Luxury was
the only means, upon one Hand, to impoverish our Nobility
and Gentry, and thereby bring them into a dependence upon
the Court for Preferment, which was the best Inducement to
make Laws to answer their own Necessities; and the more our

middle and lower sort of People are impoverish'd, the likelier
they were to submit to Wooden Shoos. Our East-India and
Turky Trade hath been the Darlings of our late Reigns, which
had their chiefest influence from our extravagant Expence in
a Foreign Consumption; and it is not the least of our Misfor∣tunes
in the present juncture of our Affairs, that the private
Interest of so many of our most considerable Traders, doth in∣terfere
with the present Necessities of the publick; this makes
a Civil War in our own Bowels, most Advices tending to the
center of private Interest; and if any thing is touch'd upon
that doth interfere, Great is Diana of the Ephesians! whilst our
Golden Fleece, the only spring of our Riches, hath been laid
open to all Nations, without so much as the guard of Alien's
Duties. It is now above forty Years since all Government in
Trade hath been laid aside, and every private Man's Rule
(both Foreigner and English) freely become his own choice;
and could the cunning of France (in whose Favour these Alte∣
