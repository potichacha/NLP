A commendacyon of welshmen


A treatise.
LOue and desire
Dooeth me require
So effectually
I can no lesse
Of gentilnesse
But graunt it willyngly.

Some payne to take
For desires sake
And herty assuraunce
With yncke and penne
The gentill Walshmenne
Their fame to aduaunce.

As shall insewe
Matter full trewe
By storis euiedent
Of auctours olde
Bothe write and tolde
Famous and excellent

Trustyng in this
No man there is
My purpose will disdayne
If my reporte
Maie them comforte
I shalbe glad and fayne.

When I consider
And call together
To my remembraunce
The regalitee
The nobilitee
The redoubted puissaunce.

The high parentage
The fearce corage
The actes moste marciall
The princely fame
The worthie name
The bloud imperiall.

The ciuilitee
The vtilitee
The high magnificence
The policie
The industrie
The noble aduertence

¶Of there progenitours
Most mightie conquerours
The enimyes to decline
Excelling farre
In strength of warre
That were before there tyme

¶Whose worthye fame
Inhauncid there name
As men of lustie corage
Like princes great
Kyngdomes to geat
For them and ther lynage

As noble brute
In his persute
And acte triumphal
To his estate
Kyngdomes gate
And made them Imperiall

First to begynne
Their birthe their kynne
Their generacion
Then to conuoy
From noble Troy
The whole procreacion.

¶Ye must then loke
In the fifth boke
Of the antiquities
Where Birosus
And Isodorus
In their Ethimolegies.

¶Affirmeth playne
As authours twayne
That after Noe his flood
The first famouse kyng
In Egipte reignyng
Was called Osiris the good.

¶But yet Moses
In Genesis
Nameth hym Mizraim
A prince of fame
The first of name
That conquest did begynne.

¶By force of strengthe
He gate at lengthe
To his dominion
The worlde rounde
Except the grounde
Dewe vnto Babilon

¶Moste circumspecte
In this effecte
Accoumpte the nobles all
He was the furst
In Egipt iust
Emonges the people rurall.

With greate industrie
And labour of bodie
The plough there did inuent
To eare and sowe
In countres lowe
Idlenes to preuente

¶To graffe and to plant
In places skante
Uynes most holsum & good
He taughte them playne
The barley grayne
To norishe the lustie bloud

¶ Hys tyme before
They hadde no store
But acornes & leves grene
No other trute
For ther refute
Emonge them was ther sene

¶Till Osyris
Of hys goodnes
Applied bothe sence and mynd
In such distres
For ther redres
Some remedy to fynd

Auctors doth accorde
He went abrode
Hys vertues onely to shewe
In straunge regions
Whose affecctions
Toke place in yeres fewe

Fyrst to Berbarye
A famose contrye
The people grosse & rude
Standyng in affryke
Them did he seke
There blyndnes to exclude

Then to Almayne
He toke the playne
That kyndome to aduaunce
Wher in lyke wyse
He dyd practise
All thing for their plesaunce

Then at the instaunce
Of the Italians
With mightie apparell
The cruell Titans
Put to vtteraunce
By fearcenes of battell

¶Full shortlie than
Doune to Tuscan
He went with all his men
To a citee strong
Large and long
Where he reigned yeres te
