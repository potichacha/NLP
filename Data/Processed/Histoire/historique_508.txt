Regula Vitae,
THE
RVLE OF
THE LAW
VNDER THE
GOSPEL.
Containing
A Discovery of the pesti∣ferous
sect of LIBERTINES,
ANTINOMIANS, and sonnes of
Belial, lately sprung up both to
destroy the Law, and disturbe
the faith of the Gospell:
Wherein is manifestly proved, that
God seeth sinne in iustified persons.

Divinity, and Pastour of S. Mary

Numb. 12. 8.Wherefore were ye not afraid to speake against
my servant Moses?
Imprinted at London by W. I. for
Robert Dawlman at the Brazen Serpent
in Paules Churchyard: 1631.
The Preface to the
godly Reader.WHat Mr. Luther
in his last Sermon
at Wittenberg ob∣served,
and fore∣tolde,
we see in these
our dayes fully performed and
accomplished: hee had observed
thirty severall sects, and secta∣ries,
raised up by Satan in his
time against that holy doctrine
preached by himselfe; all which
had hee not beene able by the
Scriptures to have resisted, and
refuted, he must have beene (as
himselfe said) of thirty severall
religions. Among them he men∣tioneth
the Anabaptists, Anti∣nomists,
Libertines, Servitians,
&c. of all whom he foretold, that

though now they (saith hee) by
the power of the word, and by the
vigilancy of godly teachers lye
close and still; yet will they be
intent, and ready on all occasions
to rise, and raise up their dam∣nable
errours to disturbe the
peace of the Church, and the
prosperity of the Gospel. And
indeede accordingly have we ob∣served
the Church of God in all
times since, lesse or more infested
with these dangerous sectaries,
I meane the Libertines, the pro∣fessed
enemies to the Law of
God, and to the holy obedience of
it. Against whom as St. Augu∣stine
in his time wrote two books
against the Adversaries of the
Law: so Mr. Calvin dealt wor∣thily
in his time, in his booke in∣tituled,Against the furious sect
of the Libertines: and many o∣ther
godly men since that time.
Let not us be offended that the
spawne and succession of those
lewd libertine sectaries are now

issued forth in troopes amongst
us, nor marvaile that the ha∣tred
of Gods most righteous
Law prevaileth amongst a rude
multitude, the sonnes of Belial;
whom Mr. Calvin calleth a
prodigious and belluine sect,
furious and madded in their opi∣nions,
and fierce as unbroken
coltes against whosoever would
curbe them, and straiten the
reines of their unbridled licen∣tiousnesse.
But rather let us
observe, 1. Satans malice in
sowing tares where good seede
was sowne, and that in the Lords
field. 2. Gods just permission of
so many schismes as tares rising
with the graine; and therein re∣venging
the contempt and diso∣bedience
of hi
