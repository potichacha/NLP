 [illustration] I RDIEV ET MON DROITHONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE [royal blazon or coat of arms] By the King.¶ A Proclamation commanding persons of qualitie to reside in their Countreys.WHereas by two former Proclamations, the one dated the twentieth of Nouember, and the other the two and twentieth of December last Wee did publish and declare Our Royall pleasure concerning the repaire of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and of other persons fo quali∣tie from the Cities of London and westminster, and other parts adia∣cent, and from other Cities and Townes vnto their Countrey dwellings: wee haue lately caused diligent suruey and enquiry to made in the Ci∣ties of London and westininster and the Suburbs of the same; whereby it appeared, That as many persons of qualitie and worth, both men and women, haue duetifully submitted to Our gracious commandement, so diuers haue not onely neglected the same, but retiring for a time vnto some in or neare the said Cities, where they secretly soiourne, or otherwise obscure and couer themselues onely to be out of the way of enquiry, doe endeauour so clude and frustrate Our sincere and Honourable intendments, whereat We aimed in both Our said Proclamations, which is the reuiuing and setling of Hospita∣litie and good Gouernment in all the parts of this Our Kingdome.

And to the intent, that none should vpon hope of alteration of Our purpose either take or keepe houses in or about the Cities of London or Westmin∣ster with intent to withdraw themselues, their wiues or families thither from their habitations in the Countrey in the winter next ensuing, We haue thought good to let them know, That Wee are
