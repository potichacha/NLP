TO THE READER


I here present you , courteous reader , with the record of a remarkable period in my life : according to my application of it , I trust that it will prove not merely an interesting record , but in a considerable degree useful and instructive .
In that hope it is that I have drawn it up ; and that must be my apology for breaking through that delicate and honourable reserve which , for the most part , restrains us from the public exposure of our own errors and infirmities .
Nothing , indeed , is more revolting to English feelings than the spectacle of a human being obtruding on our notice his moral ulcers or scars , and tearing away that `` decent drapery '' which time or indulgence to human frailty may have drawn over them ; accordingly , the greater part of our confessions ( that is , spontaneous and extra-judicial confessions ) proceed from demireps , adventurers , or swindlers : and for any such acts of gratuitous self-humiliation from those who can be supposed in sympathy with the decent and self-respecting part of society , we must look to French literature , or to that part of the German which is tainted with the spurious and defective sensibility of the French .
All this I feel so forcibly , and so nervously am I alive to reproach of this tendency , that I have for many months hesitated about the propriety of allowing this or any part of my narrative to come before the public eye until after my death ( when , for many reasons , the whole will be published ) ; and it is not without an anxious review of the reasons for and against this step that I have at last concluded on taking it .


Guilt and misery shrink , by a natural instinct , from public notice : they court privacy and solitude : and even in their choice of a grave will sometimes sequester themselves from the general population of the churchyard , as if declining to claim fellowship with the great family of man , and wishing ( in the affecting language of Mr. Wordsworth )


Humbly to express A penitential loneliness .


It is well , upon the whole , and for the interest of us all , that it should be so : nor would I willingly in my own person manifest a disregard of such salutary feelings , nor in act or word do anything to weaken them ; but , on the one hand , as my self-accusation does not amount to a confession of guilt , so , on the other , it is possible that , if it did , the benefit resulting to others from the record of an experience purchased at so heavy a price might compensate , by a vast overbalance , for any violence done to the feelings I have noticed , and justify a breach of the general rule .
Infirmity and misery do not of necessity imply guilt .
They approach or re
