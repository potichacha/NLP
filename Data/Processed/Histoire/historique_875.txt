We know well the weight of those Affairs which depend upon your Counsels, and the time that must unavoidably be spent in Debates, where there must naturally be difference of Opinion and Judgement, amongst those whose desires of the Puplique Peace and Safety, are the same; And neither We nor You must be over much troubled, if We find Our good Intentions, and the unwearied paines We take to Reduce those good Intentions into Reall Acts, for the quiet and security of the Nation, misrepresented and mis-interpreted, by those who are in truth, afflicted to see the Publique Distractions, by Gods blessing, so near an end; and, by others upon whose weaknesse, fears and jealousies, the Activity, and cunning of those Ill men, have too great an Influence.
