An account from the children of light (to them that askes) in several particulars why we have been kept from joyning to, or worshipping in those formes at law, and formes of worships, that have been imposed upon us against our consciences, in these late years, for denying whereof, we have so deeply suffered, with our lives, liberties, and estates. : Also what we owne as to those things, and can be obedient to for conscience sake, according to truth, and the practise of the church of Christ, and the Scriptures.


AN ACCOUNT From the Children of light, (to them that askes) in several particulars, why we have been kept from joyning to, or worshipping in, those formes at Law, and formes of worships, that have been imposed upon us against our consciences, in these late years, for denying whereof, we have so deeply suffered, with our lives, Liberties, and Estates.
Also what we owne, as to those things, and can be obedient to for Con∣science sake, according to truth, and the practise of the Church of Christ, and the Scriptures.
For our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our Conscience; That in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdome, but by the grace of God, we have had our conver∣sation in the world, 2 Cor. 1.12.LONDON; Printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth neare Aldersgate. 1660.
For as much as many have desired to know the ground in particulars, of our differences in faith and worship towards God, And in some things as to the outward formes at Law, which men have sought to impose upon us in these late yeares; and also what we would desire therein; there∣fore is this written following, towards the satisfying of eve∣ry honest desire, who loves the kingdome of Christ.THere is no kingdome nor people can truely be said to be the Lords and his Christs, but as they come to be guided and governed by the Law of his Spirit in their Consciences, which Spirit and anoynting all must wait for, even from the King that sits on high, to the least place of government in any people, That with it all may know Judgement, and to doe Justice, which is of God, and not of men, That he may be known, to be the anoynting of Kings, and to Judge among the Judges, whose right it is of old, and God hath given it to him by an everlasting generation, even after the power

and order of an endlesse life, That in him and in his seed may nations and kingdoms be blessed with peace, even through and in his Righteous government; for God the Father ac∣cepts neither persons, lawes, nor govern∣ments, how prudently soever they be made, if they be not in him, and from him, and for him; because for him, was made all soules that move, not onely in earth, but in heaven also; All signes, and seasons, types and sha∣dows, worship and sabbath was made for him the son of man, And no flesh breathing, nor Spirits neither, men or Angels hath any true power or right, but as they receive it in him, and so use it to him, and for him, over any of these things visible or invisible,
