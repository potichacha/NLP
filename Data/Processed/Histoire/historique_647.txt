A few WORDS to the KING And both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT, VVorthy their Consideration in a weighty Concern; to wit, the effect of the Execution of the late Act, made against Meetings and Conventicles, so called; Through which very many of the Innocent People of God have, and do deeply suffer.AND this is very certain and observable (as one deeply concerned in suffering by the aforesaid Act, my mind became exercised in a consideration of the effects thereof) that it saddens the hearts of many, yea indeed the generality of all people, to see those they know to be honest Neighbours, and good Common-wealths peo∣ple in their Countrey, to have their known truly gotten Goods and Estates driven away and spoyled, and that for nothing but the tenderness of their Consciences towards God, and for worshipping him in Spiri• and Truth; it be∣ing so much contrary to the principle of Justice in all people, even those that have but morality and civility in any mea∣sure concludes is to be, and indeed cryes it out to be a sad thing; that men and •eople the• live peaceably and harm∣lesly amongst their Neighbours, and under the Government, should be so pilledged and rob••• their Estates, even to the Impoverishing many, both Widdows and Fatherless; that how can you think 〈◊〉 to be a wo•k for God, or any thing like him or his service? or how can you think it to be a likely way to convince or bring people out of Errors or Heresie•, if you conclude us to be such? or how can it be like to bring people from a false Church, if so, to a true?

And it is also observable, that many the Informers and putters on in this work are commonly of the most vilest, and wickedest, beggarly, profainest sort of all people, such as have either wasted their own Estates, or such as are slothful, Idle, Vagrant Fellows, that never had Estates, nor will not work; but having this advantage given them, and that by Authority, seek and chuse r
