While the inhuman spectators were deriding and insulting our Lord, "one of the malefactors railed on him, saying, if thou be Christ, save thyself and us." The evangelist Mat|thew speaks in the plural number, and so doth Mark, "They that were crucified with him, reviled him." From whence many expositors suppose, that the thief, who afterwards expressed himself with such penitence and faith, at first joined in this opprobrious and impious language; but it is more probable, that the plural number is put for the singular in those e|vangelists, an hebraism frequently used in the sacred writings, and that we are to receive the acco
