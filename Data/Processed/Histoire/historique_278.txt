THE SEARCH AFTER HAPPINESS.

SCENE I.—A GROVE.
CLEORA—PASTORELLA.
Cleora.WELCOME, ye humble vales! thrice welcome, ye peaceful shades!—here innocence finds a sweet retreat—lone contem|plation here resides with happiness her guest. The reverend Hermit discovered true wisdom in directing us to such a delightful retreat. Secluded from the world, its folly, pomp and deceit; where daring guilt triumphs over unprotected innocence: where suspicion poi|sons the cup of joy; and pleasure bears the sting of remorse in her bosom, or langour, sa|tiety and disgust succeed.—You, my cousin, have ever placed happiness in the rural shades: May I be taught by you, whom I have too long despised, to woo her in these sacred haunts.

Pastorella.You need not now, my dear cousin, cease to despise the pursuits I made in search of happiness. My delight was not the peaceful shades of retirement, where no obtruding guest dare enter. The grove, the

rill, had no charms for me, if some sighing Damon did not there breathe forth the praises of Pastorella. But these hallowed groves fill my soul with horror; and I look with shame upon my past life. But who are these? They cannot be the gentle tenants of the forest, for like us they seem the children of despair.

Euph.How fortunate this meeting! our pursuits the same. We will seek her dwell|ing together, and receive more pleasure and instruction by the variety of precept, which the worthy Urania will bestow on each dif|ferent character. And by these branching oaks which seem coeval with time; by the landscape dressed in every charm of nature, I think the spot not far distant that bounds our wishes:—And look! a lovely form ap|proaches, whose innocence and cheerfulness bespeak her an inhabitant of these delightful shades.

Lau.Perhaps it is Florella, whom Fame reports as the model of female perfection.


ENTER Florella.
Flor.Fair strangers, for such I am sure you are, these uncultivated fields boast not the courtly manners you possess. May I, without the imputation of impertinent curi|osity, enquire from whence you came? If, haply, some misfortune broug
