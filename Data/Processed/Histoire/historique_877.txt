A Serious Exhortation to the People of England, &c.Dear Friends, and Country men all,WHen I seriously consider the present Calm and Quiet, the great Peace and Plenty that is in this Nation, on the one hand; and when I reflect and look back on the late impetuous Storms of Plague, Sword and Fire, that did afflict us on the other; methinks, it calls for more then ordinary praise and thanks to be returned to the Lord. Oh, Friends, Friends, retire to the Witness of God in you, and that will give you a true sence of the Mercies of God to you; I cannot, methinks, but look back on this outward Deli∣verance of this Nation, from those dreadfull Judgments wherewith we were so lately afflicted, the sence whereof is still springing up in me: How did the Plague and Pesti∣lence sweep away thousands, and tens of thousands from this great City, and many other parts and places of this Nation? how many were bereaved of their Children, of their Parents, of their Kindred, of their near and dear Relati∣ons? and how near and dear did the sence thereof go to their hearts?
