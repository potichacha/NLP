THE
ART
OF
Curing Sympathetically,
OR
Magnetically,
Proved to be most true both by its
Theory and Practice,
Exemplified by several Cures per∣formed
that way.
With a Discourse concerning the
Cure of Madness,
AND
An Appendix to prove the reality
of Sympathy. Also an account of
some Cures perform'd by it in London.

To the Right Noble
JOHN,
Lord Marquis of Normanby,
Earl of Mulgrave, Baron Sheffield,
and Knight of the most Noble
Order of the Garter, &c.My Lord,AS a Valiant Soldier is al∣ways
forward to shew
his courage in the most dan∣gerous
and difficult stratagems
of War, being incited by the
Example of his great Com∣mander
and General, who,

both in Sieges and Field-bat∣tels,
hath given such glorious
proofs of his Courage and
Conduct, that the Valiant can∣not
behold him without En∣vy,
and Cowards with∣out
Terrour. So those whom
APOLLO hath inspired to aim
at GLORY and not RICHES,
always endeavour eminently to
excel in things most difficult
or occult. The brightness of a
Genius, like the flame of a
Torch, shines most splendid in
the greatest obscurity; it ap∣pears
but mean and indiffe∣rent
in matters that are clear
and evident. I have here un∣dertook
a subject, in which

the most perspicatious have
been but Moles; and have en∣tred
the List, against almost
all Naturalists and Physicians,
that I might imitate the cou∣rage
of the Valiant Soldier,
whom the event shows, not to
be out-matcht by the greatest
danger. Right Noble Sir, I
will here prove to you and
the whole Republick of Phy∣sick,
that it is not rashly and
Emperically that I have reco∣vered
many persons by this
Sympathetick way of curing,
but by a method truly Noble
and Heroick. If I shall obtain
any Honour by this Doctrine
of Sympathy, I most humbly

dedicate it to your Honour;
if otherwise, I can offer this,
that they were always esteem∣ed
praise-worthy, who brave∣ly
fell in the engagement, tho
they could not obtain the
Victory.
Your Lordships most
humbly devoted Servant,
H. M. Herwig.THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.MAny Troops of Enemies attack
us on every side, yet if the
Combat were to be in the open Fields,
a man naturally of a brave constituti∣on,
would defie all their Forces; but
because many times they make their
onset unawares, and creep in under
the name of friendship, and do their
mischief by little and little, it is not to
be admired, if Nature in its mos
