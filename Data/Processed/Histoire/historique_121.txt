AN ESSAY, ON THE USE OF THE Celestial and Terrestrial GLOBES;

PREFACETo the ESSAY on the Globes.THE connection of astronomy with geography is so evident, and both in con∣junction so necessary to a liberal educa∣tion, that no man will be thought to have deserved ill of the republic of let∣ters, who has applied his endeavours to diffuse more universally the knowledge of these ufeful Sciences, or to render the attainment of them easier; for as no branch of literature can be fully com∣prehended without them, so there is none which impresses more pleasing ideas on the mind, or that affords it a more ra∣tional entertainment.
In the present work, several objec∣tions to former editions are obviated; the Problems arranged in a more method∣ical manner, and a great number added.

Such facts are also occasionally introdu∣ced, such observations interspersed, and such relative information communicated, as it is presumed will excite curiosity, and fit attention.
To further the design, the attention is directed to the appearance of the plan∣etary bodies, as observed from the earth. It were to be wished that the tutor would at this part exhibit to his pupil the va∣rious phenomena in the heavens them∣selves; by teaching him thus to observe for himself, he would not only raise his curiosity, but so fix the impressions which the objects have made on his mind, that by proper cultivation they would prove a fruitful source of useful employment; and he would thereby also gratify that eager desire after novelty, which contin∣ually animates young minds, and furnishes them with objects on which to exercise their natural activity.
