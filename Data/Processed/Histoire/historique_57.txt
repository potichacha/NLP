The following Tales are meant to be submitted to the young reader as an introduction to the study of Shakespeare , for which purpose his words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in ; and in whatever has been added to give them the regular form of a connected story , diligent care has been taken to select such words as might least interrupt the effect of the beautiful English tongue in which he wrote : therefore , words introduced into our language since his time have been as far as possible avoided .


In those Tales which have been taken from the Tragedies , the young readers will perceive , when they come to see the source from which these stories are derived , that Shakespeare 's own words , with little alteration , recur very frequently in the narrative as well as in the dialogue ; but in those made from the Comedies the writers found themselves scarcely ever able to turn his words into the narrative form : therefore it is feared that , in them , dialogue has been made use of too frequently for young people not accustomed to the dramatic form of writing .
But this fault , if it be a fault , has been caused by an earnest wish to give as much of Shakespeare 's own words as possible : and if the `` He said '' and `` She said , '' the question and the reply , should sometimes seem tedious to their young ears , they must pardon it , because it was the only way in which could be given to them a few hints and little foretastes of the great pleasure which awaits them in their elder years , when they come to the rich treasures from which these small and valueless coins are extracted ; pretending to no other merit than as faint and imperfect stamps of Shakespeare 's matchless image .
Faint and imperfect images they must be called , because the beauty of his language is too frequently destroyed by the necessity of changing many of his excellent words into words far less expressive of his true sense , to make it read something like prose ; and even in some few places , where his blank verse is given unaltered , as hoping from its simple plainness to cheat the young readers into the belief that they are reading prose , yet still his language being transplanted from its own natural soil and wild poetic garden , it must want much of its native beauty .


It has been wished to make these Tales easy reading for very young children .
To the utmost of their ability the writers have constantly kept this in mind ; but the subjects of most of them made this a very difficult task .
It was no easy matter to give the histories of men and women in terms familiar to the apprehension of a very young mind .
For young ladies , too , it has been the intention chiefly to write ; because boys being generally permitted the use of their father
