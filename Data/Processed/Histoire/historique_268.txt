CLOTHO, Or the first booke.WHen vainglorious Tarquine  the last of the Romaine kings for the shamefull rape of Lucrece committed by one of his sonnes, was bani∣shed from Rome & Consuls succeeded, which as the name declares, had charge of prouiding for the cōmon safetie & securitie, the Romaines changed gold for brasse, and loathing one king suffered manie tyrants, scourging their follie with their fall, and curing a festred sore with a poisoned plai∣ster: for what could be more vniust, or more contrarie to the free estate of a citie, then to subiect the whole common weale to the rule of manie potentates, and to exclude the peo∣ple from all right and interest in publique af∣faires? VVhat could be more absurd then the
 Senators onely to bestow the Consulship, the soueraigntie in warres, the supremacie in su∣perstitious offices, according to their fancie and affection, to call Senates at their pleasure, to conuocate assemblies when it seemed best for their owne profite, and to haue power of life and death vpon the bodies of their fellow citizens, & the people to liue like their slaues, being barred and restrained from marrying with the daughter of anie Senatour, as if that pray had bene too high for so low a wing, and being held in such disdaine and disreputation that common fellowship and mutuall societie was denied them, which was indeede not to liue like free men in a citie, but like villaines and bondmen in a wainscot prison, and like sillie birds in a golden cage: but when after long experience they had found, that winter succeeded sommer, & that the withered wel∣fare of their citie could not be reuiued with∣out some fortunate spring: to the intent that moderation might be induced, and that the meaner sort might beare some stroke with the mightier, that the people might enioy the sweete of the citie as well as the fathers, they
 procured a new office entituled the Tribune∣ship, whereby they might protect themselues as with a shield against the arrogant endeuors and outragious decrees of the Senatours, and thē the fellowship of mariage was brought in with the Senate, which before was prohibited the people, as if they had bene stained with some cōtagious iandise, or infected with some dangerous leprosie, and their suffrage was thē made necessarie to the election of officers, which before was as rare in that cōmon-weale as a white skin in Aethiopia.
