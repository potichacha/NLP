And whereas by the Lawes of this Realme, the inhabitants of each Parish, where such Pa∣rish is of sufficient abilitie, ought to prouide for their owne poore in all the cases aforesaid, and where the Parish shall not bee of abilitie so to doe, the whole Hundred, Lathe, or Wapentake, is chargeable therewith, but if that also by reason of the multitude of the poore, or want of abilitie of the Inhabitants be not sufficient, that then the whole County is bound to contribute thereunto, wherof the Iustices of Peace of each County, at their generall or Quarter Sessions, are to take speciall care and there order the same accordingly: To the end that a due preparation may be made herein before the Generall Sessions, in those Counties especially, where, vpon any accident
there hath fallen, or shall fall out, a more speciall occasion to prouide Stockes, and to set the poore on worke; His Maiesty doth hereby straightly charge and command, that the Ministers, Church∣wardens, and Ouerseers for the poore in euery Parish, doe forthwith assemble together, and take these things into their serious consideration, and thereof with all speede aduertise the next Iu∣stices of Peace, according to the Law, and that the Iustices of Peace in their seueral Diuisions, doe also meete at some conuenient times and places to vnderstand the true state of the poore in those parts, and thereof giue true and full information to the rest of the Iustices of the peace at the next Generall or Quarter Sessions; And that at those Sessions they all take the same into their best and most serious considerations, and settle and order the same accordingly, as that which doeth greatly tend to the glory of God, and the honour of His Maiesties gouernement, and will very much conduce to the peace, quiet, and prosperi
