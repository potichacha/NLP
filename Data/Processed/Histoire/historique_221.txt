They have made virtue so mercenary a thing, and have talked so much of its rewards, that one can hardly tell what there is in it, after all, which is worth rewarding.

DISINTERESTED LOVE, THE DISTINGUISHING ORNAMENT OF THE CHRISTIAN, AND THE DUTY OF MAN. A SERMON.PHIL. II. 4.Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man also on the Things of Others.
THIS precept of the Apostle is plain, and being delivered under the authority of in∣spiration, is infinitely binding.
THE great duty which it teaches us, is, to regard with a benevolent affection, and to endea∣vour to promote with correspondent engaged∣ness, the temporal, social, and spiritual interests of our fellow men. Though the precept does not prohibit a suitably subordinate care for our own welfare, so far as it can be consulted, in consistency with the claims of benevolence to others; it particularly inculcates, a disinterested

For by the things of others is undoubtedly meant their good, comprising their external prosperity, their peace, reputation, so∣cial comfort, and whatever is absolutely valua∣ble to them. This good of others, as in itself a valuable object, the Apostle directs us to con∣sult. As the object is of a disinterested nature, the affection enjoined must be disinterested. From the text then, this doctrine may be fairly drawn, that DISINTERESTED love is at the foundation of the Christian character, and absolutely binding on all mankind.
IN the prosecution of the discourse, I shall

1. I AM to give you an explanation of what is meant by Disinterested Love, by exhibiting its na∣ture and the manner in which it will operate and express itself. The term disinterested is not found in the Scriptures. We however make use of it, to communicate an idea of that love, which our
text and many other passages of the Bible enjoin, because it more concisely, and more forcibly expresses that idea, than it can be expressed in any other manner.
DISINTERESTED love may be
