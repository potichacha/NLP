A
SUMMARY
OR
COMPENDIUM,
OF
The Life of the most Famous
PHILOSOPHER
Renatus Descartes.
Written originally in Latin by
Peter Borellus Physitian to
the French King; to which
is also added an Epitome
of his Life by Marcus Zu∣rius
Boxhornius Historio∣grapher
at Leyden.
LONDON,

The Authors Epistle Dedicotory
to Paul Pellisonius Fontane∣rius,
Counsellor, and Secreta∣ry
to the French King, King∣dome,
and Crown of France.SInce you have vouchsafed,
from my very infancy, to
shew your benevolence towards
me, and to oblige me to you by
many signal favours; I should
be guilty of gross ingratitude,
if I left not some Monument of
my Respects to You. Permit
me therefore, Renowned Sir, to
wear your Name in the Front
of this small Treatise, which
may produce a larger. I shall
not undertake, according to the

usual mode of Epistolary Ad∣dresses
of this nature, to expa∣tiate
upon your deserved com∣mendation,
which, I am confi∣dent,
is unwelcome to You, and
sufficiently known to all the
World: All I desire is, that the
present and future Age may
testifie, that I am no waies un∣mindful
of the benefits You
have been pleased to confer up∣on
me; and that I shall ever ac∣knowledge
my self to be infi∣nitely
obliged to You:
Farewell.THis Translation, or rather
Collection, out of Peter Bo∣rellus,
Physitian to the French
King; and Marcus Zurius Box∣hornius
Historiographer in the
Ʋniversity of Leyden, presents
you with the Life of the Famous
Monsieur Descartes, giving you
an account of his Parentage and
Education, during his Minority,
as well as the Course and Method
of his Study, in his Riper Years;
together, with an exact Catalogue
of all his Manuscripts, which were
found at Stockholme in Swede∣land,
after his Death; and the
names of all his Books that have
been Published, with the Places

where they were Printed; as al∣so
the several Epitaphs that were
bestowed upon him by his Contem∣poraries,
after his Decease. If this
Epitome receive a kind entertain∣ment;
'tis very probable (when
the Author, according to promise,
exposeth a larger Treatise to pub∣lick
View, concerning this Sub∣ject)
that it may be also taught to
speak English, for the satisfaction
of those who want the advantage
of the Latine, and are only skilled
in our Mother-Tongue. This
Compendious Discourse of the Life
of so Eminent a Person, and great
a Light in the Firmament of
Learning, is all that we can

furnish you with at present, till
we meet with an opportunity to
gratifie you with a more Complete
Relation in a larger Volume.
