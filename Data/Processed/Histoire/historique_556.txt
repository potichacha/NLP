THE DEVIL UPON TWO STICKS .


1 .
ACT I .
A Room .


Enter Sir Thomas Maxwell and Margaret .
Sir Thomas .
WHY , the woman is mad !
these curs'd news-paper patriots have shatter'd her brains !
nothing less than a senator of seven years standing can conceive what she means .
Marg .
Why , Sir Thomas , my conversation is neither deficient in order , precision , or dignity .
Sir Tho .
Dignity !
and what occasion for dignity in tne common concerns of my house ?
why the deuce ca n't you converse like the rest of the world ?
If you want money to pay off my bills , you move me for further supplies ; if I turn away a  servant , you condemn me for so often changing my ministry ; and because I lock up my daughter , to prevent her eloping with the paltry clerk of a pitiful trader , it is forsooth an invasion of the Bill of Rights , and a mortal stab to the great Charter of Liberty .

and so of your daughter .
Sir Tho .
Mrs. Margaret Maxwell , bestow your advice where it is wanted !
Out of my depth ?
a likely story indeed , that I , who am fix'd here in a national trust , appointed guardian of the English interest at the court of Madrid , should not know how to manage a girl !
Marg .
And pray , Mr. Consul , what information  will your station afford you ?
I do n't deny your knowledge in export and import , nor doubt your skill in the difference between wet and dry goods ; you may weigh with exactness the ballance of trade , or explain the true spirit of a treaty of commerce ; the surface , the mere skimmings of the political pot !
Sir Tho .
Mighty well !
Marg .
But had you , with me , tra
