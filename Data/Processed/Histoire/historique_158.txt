TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, AND truly Noble, EDWARD Earle of DORSET, Lord Lieutenant of his Ma∣jesties Counties of Sussex, and Middlesex: Lord Chamberlaine to the Queene: One of the Lords of his Majesties most Honourable Priuie Councell, and Knight of the most Illustrious Order of the Garter.His Singular good Lord and Master.RIGHT HONOVRABLE,EIther by Earthly acci∣dent, or Heauenly pro∣uidence, meeting with this late imprinted French Treatise, of The Iudge∣ment of Humane Actions, written by
