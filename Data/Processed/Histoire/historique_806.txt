THE Armies Plea, FOR Their present Practice.THat the principal end of pu∣blick Government (next unto the Glory of God) is the Protection and Pre∣servation of all good men, in their peaceable & quiet living, in all Godliness and Honesty; and that the Ma∣gistrates Duty in all Forms of Government gistrates Duty in all Forms of Government whatsoever, is to defend all men from all inju∣ries, while they so live, will doubtless be gran∣ted by all that consult the Oracles of God, and Principles of Reason.
That the late Parliament did alwaies pretend to this great End, in all their publick Expresses, Remonstrances, Declarations, and Answers be∣tween the late King and them, will evidently ap∣pear to all men that shall peruse the same; the very design and tendency of many whereof, was

 relative, and conducing to common and publick Right, or Wrong; that no Governours or Governments are to be continued and tolera∣ted, which are directly and plainly destructive unto the chief End of their Original Appoint∣ment, viz. Common Good, the Common∣wealth being never obliged by any Laws (though made by their own Representatives and Tru∣stees for making
