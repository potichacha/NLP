His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both Houses of PARLIAMENT, On Wednesday the First Day of February, 1698.
LONDON, Printed by Charles Bill, and the Executrix of Thomas Newcomb, deceas'd; Printers to the Kings most Excellent Majesty. 1698.
His Majesties MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.My Lords and Gentlemen,I Came to Pass the Bill for Disbanding the Army as soon as I Understood it was Ready for Me.
Tho' in Our present Circumstances there ap∣pears great Hazard in Breaking such a Number of the Troops, And tho' I might think My Self unkindly Used, that those Guards who came over with Me to your Assistance, and have constantly Attended Me in all the Actions wherein I have been Engaged, should be Removed from Me, yet it is My fixt Opinion, that nothing can be so Fatal to Us, as that any Distrust or Jealousie
should arise between Me and My People; which I must own would have been very unexpected after what I have Undertaken, Ventured and Acted for the Restoring and Securing of their Liberties.
I have thus plainly told you the only Reason which has induced Me to Pass this Bill, and now I think My Self Obliged in Discharge of the Trust Reposed in Me, and for My own Justification, that no Ill Consequences may lie at my Door, to tell you as plainly My Judgment, that the Nation is left too much Exposed.
It is therefore Incumbent on you, to take this Matter into your Serious Conside∣ration, and Effectually to Provide such a Strength, as is Necessary for the Safety of the Kingdom, and the Preservation of the Peace which God has given Us.
FINIS.
