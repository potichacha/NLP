Superscrib'd, To the Reverend and Learned Dr Jasper Mayne, England.Sir,UNderstanding how deservedly you are numbred among the Virtuoso's of the Age, I have been emboldened upon that account, to single you out for the Per∣son whom I should certify of the most signall occurrences which have hap∣pened lately in this place; Perhaps this sheet or two may prove troublesome to the perusers of Books in generall, and something uncivill towards you in particular; why, if they do, yet as to the first the admira∣blenesse of their Subject-matter will abundantly excuse them, which was the cause of their comeing forth at all; and as to the second, your Fame will shelter them under her ca∣pacious wings, which was the cause of their comeing thus Superscrib'd: The truth is, when I found how acceptable the Ragguagli di Parnasso (publish't by my predecessor) was to the ingenious part of mankind, mee thoughts I could not but do the present and future generation a very great injury should I have concealed what now I hope may
