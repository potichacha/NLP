Martii. 1642.His Majestie hath given me expresse Command to give you this His Answer to your Petition.THat this Petition (as some others of this nature) is grounded upon mis-infor∣mation, and (being grieved and highly offended to see how His good People have been, and are abused by false Rumors and Intelligences, which have procured causlesse Fears and Apprehensions) refers the Petitioners to the two Answers He hath given to His Parliament, viz. To the Declaration presented to Him at New-Market, and to the Petition presented to Him the six and twentieth of this moneth at York: wherein you will cleerly perceive, That His Maiestie is not gone, but dri∣ven away from His Parliament, and therefore His Maiestie hath reason to think, that now (understanding the love He bears to, and Confidence He hath of His Peoples Fidelity; As likewise His constant Resolution for the maintaining of, and governing by the Laws of the Land) you may finde reason to petition the Parliament to comply with His Maiesties iust Desires, and gracious Offers, this being the onely Way, safely and speedily to cure the present Distractions of this Kingdom, and (with Gods blessing) to put a happy end to the Irish Rebellion for the effecting whereof (as His Maiestie hath often said) He will neither spare pains, nor decline any hazard of His Person or Fortune.
