Two speeches of George, Earl of Bristol, with some observations upon them by which it may appear whether or no the said Earl and others of the same principles, deserve to be involved in the common calamity brought upon Roman Catholicks, by the folly and presumption of some few factious papists.


Two SPEECHES OF GEORGE Earl of BRISTOL, With some observations upon them.
By which it may appear whether or no the said Earl and others of the same principles, deserve to be involved in the Common Calamity brought upon Roman Catholicks, by the folly and presumption of some few factious PAPISTS.
LONDON, Printed in the year. 1674
Reader.
BEing a Roman Catholick agreeing in principles with what George Earl of Bristol hath of late publickly declared of him∣self in Parliament, I could hardly bear with patience the inju∣rious censures and uncharitable constructions made of a speech of the said Honourable Persons, in the House of Peers, by di∣vers of the same Communion, though of a differing stamp in relation to Government.
They did their best to have it understood, that the persecuti∣on which seem`d to threaten Catholicks, had whetted that Earls wit to find out specious and plausible distinctions betwixt Catholick and Catholick, whereby to exempt himself from the inconveniencies likely to fall upon the generality of that pro∣fession; Distinctions which in them selves they said had no solid grounds of discrimination, and that his sentiments express`d therein, were adapted only to the present occasion.
The publishing of the said Speech in Print I thought wonld be a service to the Publick, as well as a Justice to that Lord, where∣in his distinction of Catholicks of the Church of Rome, from Catholicks of the Court of Rome, will certainly appear a right and a reasonable one: Concerning which, if the Reader rest not satisfied, but will needs descend to particular differences, he is referred to a dedication of a book lately published in Print and directed to all Catholicks of His Majesties Dominions, by one Peter Walsh, a Franciscan Fryer, wherein the chief imposals of the Court of Rome upon the more orthodox Doctrines of the Church of Rome, are faithfully and learnedly exposed.
Now as to the second part of their detraction, I thought the injuri∣ousness of it could not better be made appear, then by Printing also ano∣ther Speech of the said Earls, made to the House of Commons many years since, wherein the self-same sentiments were eminently declared by him, at a time when Roman Catholicks were as free from Alarums of any new persecution, as ever they have been during any Session of Parliament.
A Speech of GEORGE Earl of BRISTOLS made to the house of PEERS at the First reading of the Bill against Popery, upon Saturday the fif∣teenth of March, 167 2/3 The King being then present.My Lords,
I Am very sensible to what inconveniences a man of my perswasion exposes himself that offers to speak (especially to break the Ice first) to a Bill of this Nature brought up to you fr
