A Proclamation of his Highness, prohibiting the disturbing of Ministers and other Christians in their Assemblies and Meetings.IT having pleased the Lord, by the manifold Mercies and Deliverances which he has wrought in and for these Na∣tions of late years, and the blessings wherewith he has blest the endevors of the good people thereof, in making them successfull against his and their Enemies, to crown us with this, as not the least Token of his favor and good will to us. That there is a free and uninterupted passage of the Gospel running through the midst of us, and Liberty for all to hold forth and profess with sobriety, their light and knowledge therin, according as the Lord in his rich Grace and wisdom has dispensed to every man, and with the same freedom to practice and exercise the Faith of the Gospel, and to lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty, without any interuption from the Powers God has set over this Commonwealth, nay with all just and due encourage∣ment thereto, & protection in so doing by the same; a mercy that is the Price of much blood, and till of late years denied to this Nation, as at this day it continues to be to most of the Nations round about us, and which all that fear God among us ought duly to consider and be thankfull for in this Day, wherein God has so graciously visited and redeemed his people; His Highness, as he reckons it a Duty incumbent upon him, and shall take all possible care to preserve & con∣tinue this freedom and liberty to all persons in this Com∣monwealth fearing God though of differing Judgments, by protecting them in the sober & quiet exercise and profession of Religion, and the sincere worship of God, against all such who shall, by imposing upon the Consciences of their Brethren, or offering violence to their persons, or any other way seek to hinder them therein; So likewise doth hee hold himself equally obliged to take care, That on no pretence whatsoever, such freedom given should be extended by any beyond those bounds which the Royall Law of Love and Christian moderation have set us in our walking one toward another; or that thereby occasion should be taken by any
