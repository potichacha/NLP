An ordinance of the Lords and Commons, assembled in Parliament, inhibiting the importation of currans.


AN ORDINANCE OF THE LORDS and COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT, Inhibiting the importation of CURRANS.WHereas it is found by daily experience, that the Importation of Currans into this Kingdome (it being a Commodity of little or no use at all, but a meere super∣fluity, and may well bee spared) is a matter of great concernment, not only to the Merchant, but to this Nation, in regard the said Commodity cannot be had in the parts beyond the Seas, where the same are bought, without ready money, an hundred thousand pound per annum at least being bestowed in Currans, which otherwise would be brought into this Kingdome, is wholly diverted; whereas formerly (till of later yeares) the said Currans were bought for Commodities of this Kingdome, exported hence of small value, besides the great advantage which is yearly made upon the Merchant (where the said Currans are laden) to their exceeding prejudice by the high and excessive Rates and Taxes which are there imposed upon the said Commodity.

And it is further ordered that the respective Officers of the Custome-houses doe take speciall care to put this Ordinance in execution, or doe cause it to be fully executed in every point according to the true intention of the same, and that such persons as shall not obey in any of the premises shall answ
