A Leather Sash,
My Calabash,
My Powder Horn and Bullet.

A Wooden Can,
A Close-Stool Pan,

And half a Flitch of Bacon.

A Knife without a Handle,
A rusty Lamp,
Two Quarts of Samp,
And half a Tallow Candle.

My Years are spun,
My Days are done,
And so I think to leave it.

To you I fly,
You only can relieve me,
To you I turn, for you I burn,

Admit my Flame.
And grant me my Petition,
If you deny,
Alas! I die
In pitiful Condition.

3Before the News
Of your poor Spouse
Had reach'd us at New-Haven.
My dear Wife dy'd
Who was my Bride
In Anno Eighty seven.
