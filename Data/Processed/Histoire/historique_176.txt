FORCED UNIFORMITY NEITHER CHRISTIAN nor PRƲDENT.Presented To those in AUTHORITY whom it may concern.FRiends, I have had some ferrous Considerations upon my Hear: to present to you, signifying how that an Uniformity in Matters of Worship could not be in any or most of the Ages of the World, gained and maintained, effected or established, and how that the Nations of the Earth have been upon Heaps about it; and in most Ages the best Sort of Men have been Sufferers in Things appertaining to Conscience, because their Number hath been in all (or most Ages) but small in Com∣parison of the vain Multitude; and my Design here is, to sh•w or signifie to you, that in most, or all Ages, there have been Divisions in the Earth a∣bout Religion from the very first to this Day, and this Thing called Unifor∣mity, that Rulers of Nations have been striving about for some Hundreds, or as I may say, some Thousands of Years, is uneffected to this present Day, notwithstanding as much Force and Violence hath been used, as well as you or any People else can devise or invent to make Ʋse of to effect this Work: So I desire you may for the Nations Good consider of these Things; for this be assured of, I write not these Things unto you because we faint in Suffering, or grow weary of what we have taken in Hand by the constraining Power of our God, whose Presence is better to us then Life it self; but I assuredly know, there are many hundreds had rather part with Life it self, and all they have, then faint or grow weary in suffering for Christ's sake, who hath been so good and faithful a God unto them in the midst of many deep Sufferings; and I am satisfied, he that hath kept us hitherto will keep us to the End, whatever we endure for his Names sake; for we have learned to forgive our Enemies, and do Good to them that do Evil to us, and therefore do desire your Souls Good as our own, knowing that our God hath called to you by the Spirit of his Son Christ, in your Consciences, that he might deliver your Souls from Hell, and front the Horrible Pit, if you will but learn of him, and hearken to the Call of Christ, the true Light, Joh. 1.9. And so to him that searcheth the Heart, and tries the Reins, and sees every secret Thought, and is as a shining Light in your Hearts, many a Time, to give you to discern betwixt that which is good and evil, do I recoommend what here I have written.
 HAving viewed many Laws by you made about Matters of Religion and Worship, and also having cast my Eye backward into the Ages past, I do find that many Endeavours have been on Foot, and many Laws made by divers and sundry Rulers of Nations and People, both Ec∣cl•siastical and Temporal so call'd, to force Men to an Ʋniformity in Matters of Religion and Worship, for many hundreds of Years past and gone; and the Nations, and several of the Professors of the divers Sorts of Wor∣shippers have been over and
