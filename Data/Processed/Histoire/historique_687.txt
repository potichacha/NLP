A Letter from Sir LEWIS DYVE: Written out of France to a Gentleman, a Friend of his in London, &c.TO prevent the or edit that malicious and false reports may gaine, in the opinion of those that know me not, concerning my escape out of Prison, which the wickednesse of this age is most fruitfull in producing; I conceived it necessary for me, as well for the satisfaction of my private Friends, as to dis-abuse others, who for want of true informati∣on, may by delusions and forgeries (wherewith the worth, God knowes, hath of late yeares beene too much abused) be led into a mis-beliefe of me, to give you this true account, both of the occasion that induced me to thrust my selfe into so great a hazard, in the attempt (wherein, by the Al∣mighties blessing, I was in a manner miraculously preserved) as also by what meanes I effected it; which I shall desire you, even for the love which I know you beare to truth, and the particular affection wherewith you have alwayes beene pleased to honour me, that you will, if occasion be offered, publish this Paper unto the world, that the malice of my enemies may not prevaile; by their evill tongues to wound me behind my back, in my honour and reputation, which I have ever held in farre dearer esteeme then my life.

For if I should begin my Storie from thence, it would fill a volume, and carry in it many bitter markes of the strange inhumanitie of these sad times, which for the honour of this Nation I could heartily wish, (were it possible) that both in my owne case, and divers others of like nature, the memory might eternally be forgotten, and no record left thereof to re∣maine as a brand of infamy upon this people to all posteritie.
It shall therefore suffice, that I begin from the time of my being remo∣ved from the Tower, where I continued above two yeares, and the greatest part of that time close Prisoner; from whence towards the latter end of last Michaelmas Terme, I was by pretence of a Hab
