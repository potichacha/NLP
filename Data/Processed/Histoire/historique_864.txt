❧ By the Queene.WHereas of late yeeres, there hath ben an intermission of the free traffike of Marchants, betwixt the kingdomes and countreys of the Queenes Maiestie of England, and the king of Portugall, by reason of certaine stayes and arrests made of diuers subiects on both partes, with their goods and shyps, to the hynderaunce and discommoditie of both the sayd Realmes and kyngdomes, without any intention of either of the sayd Princes to breake or violate the auncient amities and con•ederati∣ons continuing in force betwixt them, or to discontinue the sayd traffike: but that, as it appeareth, the same arrestes haue ben first occasioned by persons regarding more their priuate gaine, then the continuaunce of such an auncient amitie, nourished and maintayned by the mutual com∣merce of the subiects on eyther part. So it is, that both their Maiesties good meanings towardes the continuance of their mutuall amitie, and restoring of the sayd traffike, being made knowen from the one to the other by such their good ministers as haue beene herein vsed: Therefore it is in their names accorded, that all maner subiects of both the sayd Princes, of what kingdome or Countrey so euer they be, from the xv. day of this present moneth of Nouember, shall and may from the sayde time vse the like mutuall traffike for Marchandizes, and in the same places: that is to say, her Ma∣iesties subiects, in the kingdomes of Portugall and Algarbia, and in the Iles of Medera and Azore: and likewise the subiects of the kyng of Portugal, in England and Ireland, as they were lawfully accustomed before the said arrestes. And for that it is meant, that all occasions of controuersies and differences, that haue happened betwixt the subiects of either part, since the time of the sayd arrests, should be heard and determined: It is ordeyned, that this restitution of the traffike, shall remayne from the said xv day of Nouember, during the space of three yeeres next ensuing, to the intent that diuers Commissioners (to be appointed by the said Princes withithin three moneths after the sayde xv day of this Nouember) may speedily heare, order, and determine, such differences: And that at the end of the sayd three yeeres, yf by the sayd Princes in the meane time it be not otherwise prouided for continuaunce of the sayd traffike to haue a perpetuall continuaunce, no new arrestes shalbe made of any things brought into the kingdomes and Iles aforesayd, of eyther of the sayd princes, during the time of the sayd three yeeres. Wherefore the Queenes Maiestie hath thought it necessary, like as it is agreed, that they sayd king of Portugall shall do the like, to notifie to all her subiects the pre∣misses, to thintent they may (as they shall finde meet and conuenient) resort to the kingdomes and Ilandes aforesayd of the sayd king, and there vse the lawfull and free traffike of Marchaundizes, as
