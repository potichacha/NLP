A
LETTER
From His
EXCELLENCIE
THE
Lord General Monck,
•nd the OFFICERS under his Command,
TO THE
PARLIAMENT;
the Name of Themselves, and the Souldiers under
Them.
LONDON:
Printed by John Macock. 1660.
A LETTER of his Excellency and his
Officers, &c.Mr. Speaker,WE cannot but with thank∣fulness
acknowledge the
wonderful Goodness of
God to you, in your Return to the Dis∣charge
of your remaining Trust; and to
our selves, and your Forces under our
Commands, (after some difficulties) in
bringing of us, by a tedious March, in
such safety to this place, to wait upon you
in asserting the Freedoms of our Native
Country: and being here, (as we have
to our utmost Hazard and Power been
instrumental in your Return, so) we
shall be still ready to pursue your Com∣mands
so far as possibly we may. To
evidence which, we have observed and ex∣ecuted
your late Orders in relation to the

Chains, Posts, and Gates of the City;
which was something grievous to Us, and
to the Officers and the Souldiers under
our Commands; and that because we
do not remember any such thing was a∣cted
upon this City in all these Wars;
and we fear that many sober people are
much grieved at it, and apprehend fur∣ther
force to be offered to them, while
they seem principally to desire the speedy
filling up of the House, which you have de∣clared
for, as well as we have express'd our
just desires of; and are apt to doubt, lest,
what we have done, may be so far from
answering the expected end, as that it may
encrease the discomposure of mens spirits
in the Nation. Upon this occasion, it
comes fresh into our minds, that when
by the treachery of some Officers of the
Army you were interrupted, we declared
to the world, That the Ground of our un∣dertaking

was not onely your return to your
Trust, but also, the Vindication of the Li∣berties
of the People, and the Preservation
of the Rights of our Country, the Protecti∣on
and encouragement of the Godly and
Faithful therein, as the establishment of
the Peace of these Nations. Which De∣clarations
made before the Lord, Angels
and Men, in the day of our Extremity,
we (as we expect the blessing of the Lord
upon our future Undertakings) cannot
but still own, and stand by.
We finde that the asserting of the just
Liberties of the People, is that which the
generality of the Nation is much in ex∣pectation
of; and that many sober people
(together with our selves) are under fears
lest this great price that God hath put in∣to
your and our hands, (as your Ser∣vants)
should not be improved, but that
we shall run in Confusion again. There∣fore

we humbly crave leave to present be∣fore
you, some Grounds of our Fears:
We are affraid that the late wonderful
and unparallell'd Deliverance, is not so
publickly and solemnly acknowledged as
it might be, that the Lord (who wrought
so stupendiously) may have the Glory
