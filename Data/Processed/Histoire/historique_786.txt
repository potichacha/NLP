THE AUTHOR's APOLOGY.SEEING this subject has employed the pens of some of the most learned, wise, and best of men, it may be enquired why I have written, and what need there is of publishing again on this subject?
ANSWER. First. Many may read this, who never have read, and probably never will read what has been written by others.
