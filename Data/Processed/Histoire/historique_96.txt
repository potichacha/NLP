ABERDENE, Printed by Edward Raban, Printer to the Citie and both Colledges. 1625.
TO THE TRVELY HONORED, and worthily worshipfull, SIR ALEXANDER GORDON, Knight-Baronet of Clunie, &c.
WHen these CHARACTERS curt, and short ESSAYES,
Right Worshipfull, vnworthie of Your view,
At some successiue Hours, on ydle dayes,
My Pen, for Pinsell; Coale, for Co∣lours, drew,
I stood, and studi'd, whose praeponed Name▪
Should dye in Graine, and Luster lend to Them▪

My Wits conven'd, and in my Braine combynd,
The free and friendlie Favours that I fand,
With th'ever-courteous Countenance and kynd,
That I haue alwayes at Your Honours Hand;
Advise mee onlie, that Your Worship shall
Giue Luster, Life, Dye, and adorne Them all.

Deigne then t'accept Them with that wonted Grace,
Smoothe Front, and Face, that I did ever find:
Which perfectlie doth point out, and expresse
The Gen'rose Sprite, the wise and worthie Mind,
Which doth before the Worke, and Work-mans Skill,
In given-Gifts, regard the Givers Will.
Your Worships ever Devoted, ALEXANDER GARDEN.TO THE READER.
EN•… I and tenderlie entreat,
If you haue teasure, and th'Effayres not great,
To take some tyme, and to survey this Table:
VVhich well perused, shall prooue pro∣fitable.
VVhere thou thy selfe in some of these shalt see
Portrayd, if eyther Good or Bad tho•… bee.

If good, insist, and make a Progresse still:
And if perverse, pray, and repent thine ill.
But I would wish, that thou thy selse find foorth,
Amongst the best and worthie for thy worth.
Disdaine not then, nor loathe thou for to looke
Vpon the Tenor of this tabled Booke.

Nor scorne thy Misses mongst these Maps to marke,
Albeit they bee not cut in curious VVorke:
As these, Apelle•…•…o •…he Lyfe had limm'd
Or Hondius hand had them attyrd and trimm'd,
Yet sagely searched thou in These shalt see,
The not to please, yet what may profit thee.

Even as justly you merit
So AL GARDEN inherit.
CHARACTERS AND ESSAYES.A worthie King.
A Worthie King, of GOD OM∣NIPOTENT,
Is in the Nature of Governament,
The verie Figure and the Image: Then
Hee is the Chiefe and Quintescence of Men.
The Champion of the Church next GOD is Hee,
And the Protector of the Policie.
The Lator of the Lawes and of the same
The strength and force, of those that hee doth frame.
The Sword of Iustice is the King to kill,
And Mercies Scepter too, when ere Hee will.
The Glasse of Grace, the eye of Honour, and
The Blessing of the LORD vnto his Land.
Lyfe vnto Loyaltie, to Treason Terrour,
To Reason Rule, and Arbiter to Errour:
His power Soveraigne is, and his Command,
Most absolute, and vncontroll'd must stand.
His frowne is Death, keene as a killing Knife,
And in the favour of his looke, is Life.
Hee is a Pilote, and His Bounds the Barge:
And all His Subjects therein, are His Charge.
Their Peace, His Pleasure, Q•…etnesse his Care,
And their kinde loue, doth his content declare.
Hee hath no Paralele, since in
