A Declaration of King James, made in Scotland, Anno Dom. 1585. Concerning Church-Government.FOr so much as here are some evill affected men, that go about (so farre as lyeth in them) to invent lyes and ca∣lumnies to stain and impair the Kings Majesties fame and honour, and raise brutes as if his Majestie had declined to Papistry, and had made many Acts to derogate the free passage of the Gospell, good order and discipline in the Church, which brutes are nourisht and entertained by rebellious subjects, who would gladly cover their seditious enterprises under pretext of religion, albeit there can be no religion in such as raise armour and disquiet the estate of their native Soveraign, and perjuriously have contraried the Oath bond and obligation of their faith, whereunto they have sworn and subscribed.
