To all the people who meet in the steeple-houses in England and elsewhere


To all the PEOPLE Who meet in the STEEPLE-HOUSES IN ENGLAND, And elsewhere.THE mighty day of the Lord is coming, therof 〈◊〉 Christ is crying, and God that made the world, dwelleth not in temples made with hands, neither is he worshipped in the Steeplehouses which ••e made with mens hands, and you think to worship him there; but God is a Spirit, and must be worshipped in spirit and in truth; and he hath given to every one a measure of his spirit to profit withall; in the spirit is God wor∣shipped, the Father of spirits; for there was a time that there was an outward temple which God com∣manded; but for witnessing against it, and witnessing the Scripture, Stephen was stoned to death, Acts 7.
And Paul for witnessing against it, and saying, God that made the world doth not dwell in Temples made with hands, was persecuted. God is a spirit, & must be worshipped in spirit, in that spirit that gave forth the Letter; which spirit was in them that gave it forth. So all you that have the letter in England which was given forth by that spirit, and calls a steeplehouse a Church, and do not worship God in spirit, therefore to you all this is sent a Message from the Lord Jesus Christ in England, or elsewhere, into all the steeple-houses, or elsewhere to be read; for God is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth; and such were drove out of the synagogues, drove out of the Idols temple, and drove together, and so an Epistle was written to them: And God is the same, he is a spirit, and his spirit is drawing from all steeplehouses now where it is ruling, the spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, in which spirit have all the saints unity, which spirit draws up to God; but ha∣ving not the spirit, but the letter, as the world have, there are the sects and all the opinions; one saith there is Christ, and another saith, Lo there is Christ; one saith this is the meaning, and another saith this is the meaning; and these are them that witnesse Oxford and Cambridge the two Mothers of Divinity, which now the Lords hand is against, and his sword is drawn against; and the spirit draws from all stee∣plehouses and teachers which have the Law to guard them, that none must speak but themselves, if they do, either to the stocks with them, or knock them down, or imprison them, or persecute them with hands or tongues, or limit them with their law which the beast hath made; these are the cage of unclean birds which
the spirit prophesied of in the Revelations, and their mother of harlots, who are harlotted from the spirit, the true worship of the living God; but now is the day of the Lord coming that all things shall be made manifest, and discovered and seen; all you which are without the life which gave forth the Scriptures, you have the letter onely which proceeds from the life, and your Teachers made at Oxford & Cambridge, which are called of men Masters, which the woe i
