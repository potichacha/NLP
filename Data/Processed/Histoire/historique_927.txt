His Majesties GRACIOUS MESSAGE To the COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT, January, the Fourth, 1680/81.CHARLES R.HIS Majesty receiv'd the Address of this House, with all the disposition they could wish, to comply with Their rea∣sonable Desires; but upon perusing it, He is sorry to see their Thoughts so wholly fix'd upon the Bill of Exclusion, as to determine that all other Remedies for the suppressing of Popery will be ineffectual: His Majesty is confirm'd in His Opinion against that Bill by the Judgement of the House of Lords, who rejected it. He therefore thinks there remains
nothing more for Him to say in answer to the Address of this House, but to recommend to Them the Consideration of all other Means for the Preservation of the Protestant Religion, in which They have no reason to doubt of His Concurrence, whenever they shall be presented to Him in a Parliamentary Way; and that They would Consider the Present State of the Kingdom, as well as the Condition of Christen∣dom, in such a manner, as may enable Him to preserve Tangier, and secure His Alliances abroad, and the Peace and Settlement at home.
