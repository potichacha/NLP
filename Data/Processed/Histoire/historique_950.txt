TO THE CITIZENS of New-York, On the present critical Situation of Affairs.WERE I neither a Philadelphian, a New-Yorker, a Bostonian, nor even a native of this continent, as a friend to the rights of mankind, I should interest myself in the fate of America. America must at present be considered as the principal, or indeed the only remaining seat of liberty —In Corsica, Sweden, Poland she has been borne down by the direct hand of violence; and in our parent country, she is sapp'd by corruption to so dangerous a degree, that she totters from the foundation, and unless propp'd by the virtue and spirit of her colonies, she must inevitably fall to the ground. A regular plan has been formed by the present court, for the introduction of arbitrary power;—this is no declamation, and did the size of this paper admit of it, I could prove the truth of the assertion by numberless instances: The privileges, and indeed natural rights of the subject, have been invaded in every part of the empire, one while by open force, another by cabal and the arts of corruption —Even the islands of Mi|norca, Jersey, Guernsey, have not been protected by their insignifi|cance, from the scourge of tyranny.—Great Britain and Ireland have been drained almost to the last farthing, not for any national purposes, but to increase the influence of the crown, in creating new placemen, pensioners, and of course enemies to the public welfare, and liberty.

Every writer in support of boundless prerogative, every jacobite histo|rian, (the Humes, Guthries and Smollet's) has been caressed, placed or pensioned. Attacks have been made under the auspices of the court, not only on the revolution, and the principal promoters of the revo|lution, but a scheme has been laid, and to the utmost of their power carried into execution, to proscribe virtue herself, by subverting the reputation of her brightest models—They argue thus, if we can spread the persuasion, that public virtue never did exist in a human breast that patriotism has been in all ages only a mask for designing men; we shall gain the following point, we shall render mankind totally indiffer
