His Majesties last Speech, to the Lords of his Privie Councell, concer∣ning the Londoners Petition for Peace.My Lords,RVmour, which in that uttered nought but truth, brought us hither about a fortnight si•ce, a report, that divers able inhabi∣tants of our capitall City of London had presented in a Petition their humble de∣sires to ou• high Court of Parliament, to take some spe•dy and eff•••ual course for s••h•g all the differences •e•ween us and them; the printed Copy of which Petition c••e afterwards to Our hands.

For if they be as ready to propound reasonable conditions for that purpose, as we shall be to embrace and ratifie them when propounded, the•e will not be much diffi∣culty in the matter; many Suns more will not go down up∣on our anger, we shall have all peace and quietnesse. But
 what our Parliament hath in that case determined, hath not yet arrived our knowledge. A very hard destiny, both for Our selfe and them, that We, who had wont to communi∣cate all matters of consequence and waight, which either concerned Our self or the Common-wealth, with a mutuall freedome, should now breath at such a distance, that Wee have no affinity of converse one with another. But those ruptures may yet in good time be made up, and (like bones, when broken and well set againe) the unity betweene us may knit faster, after this long breach betwixt us. We have since been credibly informed, and (We hope) no more then truth, that the best of our said City of London, and not the meanest number of its inhabitants, intend (by their agents deputed for that purpose) to pre
