TO THE HONOURABLE JOHN TEMPLE, ESQUIRE, HIS MAJESTY's LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOUR OF THE PROVINCE OF NEW-HAMPSHIRE IN AMERICA; A BENEFACTOR TO THE CHURCH AT CAMBRIDGE, AND A FRIEND OF THE AUTHOR: THIS SERMON IS GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED BY HIS OBLIGED SERVANT EAST APTHORP.
A PRAYER.O GOD, the father of lights, author of truth and virtue, from whom descendeth every good and perfect gift; we most humbly beseech thee, through the mediation of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, favourably with thy mercy to hear our prayers, and grant all our petitions agreable to thy will. For the merits of thine only SON, accept our unworthiness; give us true Repentance, and pardon all our Sins.

Above all, we labour to express our thanks and praise, for thy love to a sinful and apostate world, in restoring to us again the

Bless and prosper the reformed Churches, espe|cially the Church of England, and its supreme head on earth, our sovereign Lord the King. So dispose and govern his heart, that he may ever seek thy honour and glory, and preserve thy people in wealth, peace and godliness. Bless our most gra|cious Queen, his Royal Highness the Prince, and all the royal Family; endue them with thy HOLY SPIRIT, and prosper them with all happiness. Bless the Nobility, Clergy and Magistracy; especially the Governour o
