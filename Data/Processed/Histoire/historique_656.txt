An ACT for the better Ordering and Regulating such as are willing and de∣sirous to be united for military Purposes within this Province.Whereas this Province was first settled by, and a Majority of the Assemblies have ever since been of, the People called Quakers, who, though they do not, as the World is now circumstanced, condemn the Use of Arms in others, yet are principled against bearing Arms themselves; and to make any Law to compel them thereto, against their Consciences, would not only be to violate a Fundamental in our Constitution, and be a direct Breach of our Charter of Privileges, but would also, in Effect, be to commence Persecution against all that Part of the Inhabitants of the Province; and for them, by any Law, to compel others to bear Arms, and exempt themselves, would be inconsistent and partial; yet, foras∣much as by the general Toleration, and Equity of our Laws, great Numbers of People of other religious Denominations are come among us, who are under no such Restraint, some of whom have been disciplined in the Art of War, and conscientiously think it their Duty to fight in Defence of their Country, their Wives, their Families, and Estates; and such have an equal Right to Liberty of Conscience with others;

And whereas the Governor hath frequently recommended it to the Assembly, that, in preparing and passing a Law for such Purposes, they should have a due Re∣gard to scrupulous and tender Consciences; which cannot be done where compulsive Means are used to force Men into military Service:
Therefore, as we represent all the People of the Province, and are composed of Mem∣bers of different religious Persuasions, we do not think it reasonable that any should, thro' a Want of legal Powers, be in the least restrained from doing what they judge it their
