LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of JOHN BILL. 1642.
To The KINGS most Excellent MAjESTIE, The humble PETITION of the MAjOR, ALDERMEN, and COMMONS of the City of LONDON;ShewethTHat the Petitioners, Your Majesties most humble and Loyall Subjects, being much pierced with the long and great divisions be∣tween Your Majestie and both Your Houses of Parliament, and with the sad and bloody effects thereof, both here and
 in Ireland, are yet more deeply wounded by the misapprehension which Your Ma∣jestie seemeth to entertain, of the Love and Loyaltie of this Your City, as if there were some cause of Fear, or suspi∣cion of Danger to Your Royall Person, if Your Majestie should return hither; And that this is made the unhappy Bar to that blessed Reconciliation with Your great and most faithfull Councell, for preventing that desolation and destru∣ction, which is now most apparently im∣minent to Your Majestie and all Your Kingdoms.
For satisfaction therefore of Your Majestie, and clearing of the Petitioners Innocencie, they most humbly declare, (as formerly they have done) that they are no way conscious of any disloyaltie, but abhor all thoughts thereof: And that they are resolved to make good their late solemn Protestation and Sacred Vow made to Almighty God, and with the last drop of their dearest bloods to defend and maintain The true Reformed
 Protestant Religion; and according to the dutie of their Allegiance, Your Majesties Royall Person, Honour and Estate, (what ever is maliciously and most falsely suggested to Your Majestie to the contrary) as well as The Power and Priviledges of Parliament, and The lawfull Rights and Liberties of the Subject: And do hereby engage them∣selves, their Estates, and all they have, to their uttermost power, to defend and pre∣serve Your Majestie and both Houses of Parliament from all Tumults, Affronts and Violence, with as much Loyaltie, Love and Dutie, as ever Citizens ex∣pressed towards Your Majestie or any of Your Royall Progenitours in their great∣est Glory.
THe Petitioners therefore upon their bended knees do most humbly be∣seech Your Majestie to return to Your Parliament (accompanied with Your Roy∣all, not Your Martiall Attendance) to the end that Religion, Laws, and Liberties may be setled and secured, and whatso∣ever
 is amisse in Church and Common∣wealth, reformed by their Advice,
