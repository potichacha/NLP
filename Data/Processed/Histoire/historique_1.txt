 [illustration]  [royal blazon or coat of arms] C RHONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSEBY THE KING.A Proclamation for a generall Fast to he held throughout this Kingdome on the second Friday in every Moneth.VVHen a generall Fast was first propounded unto Vs, in contemplation of the miseries of Our Kingdome of Ireland, We readily gave Our Consent unto it, and in Our Court, and in Our Person have duely observed it, as a Religious duty, fit to be exercised in a time of common Calamity. But when VVe have seen what ill use hath been made of those publicke meetings under the pretence of Religion, in Pulpits, and Prayers and Sermons of many seditious Lecturers to stir up and continue the Rebellion raised against Vs within this Kingdome; And that those who first moved and seemed to affect the reliefe of Our distressed Subjects of Ireland, have deserted the care thereof, and diverted the Meanes ordained for the support and preservation of that Kingdome, to the destruction of Vs and of this Kingdome of England: VVe have thought it fit to Command that such an Hypocriticall Fast, to the dishonour of God, and the slander of true Religion be no longer continued and countenanced by Our Authority, which hath been too long continued already, to such false and Traiterous ends. And yet VVe being desirous (as by Our duty to Almighty God VVe are bound) by all possible meanes to expresse Our own Humiliation, and the Humiliation of Our People, for Our owne sins, and the sins of this Nation, (as VVe have great cause) are resolved to continue a Monthly Fast, but not on the day formerly appointed and so much abused by those who are in Rebellion against Vs, by using it as a principall Engine to their owne de∣signes.

And to the end that with one heart and voice we may performe so Religious an Exercise, we have caus
