¶ Now synge we as we were wont
Vexilla regis prodeunt.

THe kiges baner on felde is playd
He cross{is} mistry cānot be nayd
To whom our sauyour was betrayd
And for our sake
Thus sayth he / I suffre for the
My deth I take
Now synge we. &c.

Behold my shankes behold my knees
Beholde my hed armes and thees
Beholde of me nothyng thou sees
But soro we and pyue
Thus was I spylt, man for thy gylte
And not for myne.
Now synge we. & c

Behold my body how Iewes it donge
wt knots of whipcord & scourges strong
As stremes of a well ye blode out sprōg
On euery syde
The knottes were knyt
Ryght well made with wyt
They made woundes wyde
Now syng we. &c.

¶ Man yu shalt now vnderstand
Of my head, bothe fote and hand
Are four. ¶. and fyue thousand
woundes, and syxty
Fyfty and. vii. were tolde full euen
Vpon my body
Now syng we. &c.

¶ Syth I for loue bought the so dere
As thou may se thy self here
I pray the with a ryght good chere
Loue me agayne
That it lykes me
To suffre for the
Now all this payne.
Now syng we. &c.

¶ Man vnderstand now thou shall
In sted of drynke they gaue me gall
And eysell mengled therwithall
The iewes fell
These paynes on me, I suffred for the
To bryng the fro hell
Now syng we. &c.

¶ Now for thy lyfe thou hast mysled
Mercy to aske be thou not adred
The lest drop of blode that I for ye bled
Myght clense the soone
Of all the syn
The worlde within
If thou haddest doone
Now syng we. &c.

¶ I was more wrother with Iudas
For he wold no mercy aske
Than I was for his trespas
whan he me solde
I was euer redy
To graunt hym mercy
But he none wolde
Now syng we. &c.

¶ Lo how I hold my armes abrode
The to receyue redy I sprede
For the great loue that I to the had
well may thou knowe
Some loue agayne
I wolde full fayne
Thou woldest to me shewe
Now syng we. &c.

¶ For loue I aske nothyng of the
But stand fast in faythe, & syn thou fle
And payne to lyue in honeste
Bothe nyght and day
And thou shalt haue blys
That neuer shall mys
withouten nay.
Now syng we. &c.

¶ Now Iesu for thy great goodnes
That for man suffred great hardnes
Saue vs fro the deuyls cruelnes
And to blys vs send
And graūt vs grace, to se thy face
withouten ende.
Now. &c.
¶ Finis.
IF thou be Iohan I tell it the
Ryght with a good aduyce
Thou may be glad Iohn̄ to be
It is a name of pryce
The name of Io. wel prays I may
It is full good y wys
The grace of god, it is to say
It soundes nothyng amys
If thou be kyng in ryalte
And of wyt full wyse
Thou mayst be glad Iohn̄ to be
It is a name of pryce
If thou be Iohn̄. &c.

¶ He is not worthy to hyght Iohn̄
The oxe that is not whyght
And thou art not worthy to hight iohn̄
But grace be in the pyght
If thou haue loue and charyte
And voydest away all vyce
Than art thou worthy Iohn̄ to be
It is a name of pryce
If thou be Iohn̄. &c.
