MR. PARISH'S SERMON, ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ORDINATION.
THE EXCELLENCE OF THE GOSPEL VISIBLE IN THE WRETCHEDNESS OF PAGANISM. A DISCOURSE DELIVERED DECEMBER 20, 1797, BEING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS ORDINATION, By ELIJAH PARISH, A. M. MINISTER OF THE CONGREGATION IN BYFIELD.
Printed by A. MARCH, Newburyport. Jan. 1798.
TO the Congregation in BYFIELD, with the best wishes and services of the Preacher, this Discourse is cor|dially dedicated.
IT was hastily written without a thought of publication. The request of Friends is the only apology for its being made public. It would require several sermons to do justice to the subject.
If this imperfect miniature excite any curiosity for further enquiry; if any be more forcibly impressed with the value of christian privileges; if any good be done; the author has a rich reward.
LUKE, iv. xviii.To heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised.
TO understand the nature of the objects a|round us, justly to estimate their value is a high attainment of knowledge.
HAVING informed our minds and obtained right opinions, then to direct our desires, our pursuits, and our zeal, according to the nature of their ob|ject, is the summit of human goodness.
THE husbandman, therefore, may highly value his farm, the mechanic his shop, the mariner his com|pass, the man of science his books; because these things are necessary to their mode of living.
THE man of moral reflection, enquiring whence his origin, what his destination, what his present du|ty, what his future prospects, finds the gospel essen|tial to his peace here, to his happiness hereafter. To him the gospel is precious. He is "blind." He ex|plores the resources of his own mind; he learns the philosophy of the wise; he finds light, only, in the volume of revelation. His conduct is wrong; his passions lead him 'captive.' To restrain himself he thinks of his interest, of his reputation; he finds commanding motives of goodness, only in the book of God. Here he reads the sinner's end; he trembles; he obeys. To bind our lusts, reputation and interest are no better than Samp|son's bursting cords.
IMPERFECT man feels remorse, his spirit is 'bro|ken;' he concludes himself under condemnation; the revelation of christians furnishes a balm to 'heal'

his bleeding heart. With terrors he is enslaved; the gospel gives 'liberty' and joy. The text as|cribes to the gospel all these excellencies. The gos|pel heals the broken hearted, consoles the anguish of a guilty conscience: it gives freedom to the slaves of sin: It gives sight to the blind, knowledge to those ignorant of moral truth.
TO ILLUSTRATE THE VALUE OR EXCELLENCE OF THE GOSPEL IS OUR PRESENT OBJECT.
