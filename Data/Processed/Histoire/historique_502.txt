Die Sabbathi Januar. 7. 1642.A Declaration of Both Houses of Parliament, shevving the necessity of a present Subscription of Money and Plate, for further supply of the ARMY.THe pressing necessities of this Kingdome, caused, and daily multiplyed by the trayterous and bloody counsels and attempts of those pernicious and desperate Counsellors, still about the King, and protected by him, while they more and more manifest their implacable enmity to our religion, the Parliament, and peace of all his Majesties good Subjects and Dominions, have beene such, and so many, as have compelled Us the Lords and Com∣mons Assembled in Parliament, to borrow moe and far greater sums of money, upon the Publique Faith, (besides those which we our selves advan∣ced for the preservation of our Religion, the being (as well as the just and undoubted power and priviledges of Parliament, our Lawes and Liberties, from most apparent destruction) then at first we intended, and to be longer in repaying the same (which we still unanimously resolve shall be fully paid backe with interest) then heretofore we promised.
