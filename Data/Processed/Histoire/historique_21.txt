A LETTERFrom Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, Thomas Scot, Io. Berners, and Iohn Weaver Esquiers, delivered to the Lord Fleetwood:Owning their late Actions in endeavour∣ing to secure the Tower of London, and Expostulating his Lordships defection from his Engagement unto the Parli∣ment.SIR▪UNderstanding you have received▪ some disturbance of late in examining divers persons about a designe to surprize the Tower, to save your further trou∣ble we doe hereby freely own our utmost and hearty endeavours to have put that place into more faithful and confiding hands, and that by Authoritie from the Coun∣cil of State, who at the passing of that Resolve, had the

Sir, We have the witnesse with our own Spirits that we have and doe Cordially wish the preservation and good of you and your Family, but if the Lord hath said, you shall not hearken, but be hardned in your way, we must acquiesce in his Providence, and with sorrow look upon that Ruine which is flowing in upon you, as upon one in whom we th
