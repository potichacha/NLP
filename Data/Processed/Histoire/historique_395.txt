WHereas a printed paper was lately
put forth in the names of some
of the Trustees for Ministers
maintenance, wherein amongst
other things they take upon
them without warrant to dis∣charge
all Incumbents from
whom any First-fruits are due,
from paying the same unto
Mr. Thomas Baker at the First-fruits Office in the Strand
in the County of Middlesex, These are to give no∣tice
to all persons concernd, that they are notwithstand∣ing
to apply themselves to the accustomed place and
persons, for dispatch of all businesses which have or do
belong to the said Office, it being an Office established
by several Acts of Parliament never yet repealed nor al∣tered
by the present or any former Government, and that
they pay their monies there, where their securities re∣main,
which shall be delivered up to them upon pay∣ment
of the same, and without which they can no way
be legally discharged or secured by any other persons upon
any pretence whatsoever, nor free themselves from the
process of the Court of Exchequer, which in discharge of
the Officers duty must be issued, to bring all persons con∣cerned
to conformity in payment of the States Revenew.
Dated at the First-fruits Office aforesaid, the Eighteenth
day of November 1655.Thomas Baker.
