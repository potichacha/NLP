MY LORD , While the recess still affords comparative leisure for the consideration of such questions as may be brought forward during the approaching Session of Parliament , permit me respectfully to solicit your attention to a brief notice of the objections which have been made to the passing of the Infant 's Custody Bill - a measure which , from its being introduced with the hope of remedying a defect of power in the courts under your Lordship 's immediate jurisdiction , as well as from the fact of your acting as Parens Patri√¶ for the Sovereign of these realms , would seem entitled to your especial consideration .
From the strong position at first taken by the opponents of this measure , namely , that the legislature had no power to interfere with `` the divine prescriptive right '' of fathers over their children , they have been fairly beaten .
It is proved that the law page : 2 has interfered , and does interfere with the father 's right of custody , though hitherto only in cases where property has been concerned ; and the question is simply whether there shall be an interference for the sake of the mother , as well as for the sake of pounds ; shillings , and pence ; and , if so , then in what way such interference can be rendered practicable or advantageous .
So far from doubting the power of the legislature to decide on this , many opposed the plan introduced last session , because they considered it a half measure ; one which did not go far enough : and even Lord Brougham , ( whose great talents and restless energies were employed , for the hour , in opposing Serjeant Talfourd 's Bill , ) after arguing that women endured no greater injustice in this respect than in many others which he enumerated , observed that it might be matter of consideration whether such a provision should not be enacted as would give power , when the husband was parted from the wife on account of cruelty or adultery , to transfer the custody of the children entirely from the father to the mother ; or such other person as under the circumstances it might seem proper to name ; thus admitting to the fullest extent the power of the legislature to interfere ; even while giving his most strenuous opposition to the particular plan of interference at that time proposed .
Indeed , the degree of admission on the part of the legislature , of the `` divine prescriptive right '' of a father to the custody of his children , appears to be page : 3 exceedingly vague ; for , although it be ruled that this right shall extend to the hour of an infant 's birth , and accordingly a decision to that effect was given in the case of De Manneville , where the babe was torn from the nursing mother 's breast ; yet it appea
