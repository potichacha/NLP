LONDON, Printed for William Shrowsbery, at the Bible in Duke-Lane, 1681.
THE PREFACE.NO part of History is more instructive and delighting, than the Lives of great and worthy Men: The shortness of them invites many Rea∣ders, and there are such little and yet remarkable passages in them, too inconsiderable to be put in a gene∣ral History of the Age in which they lived; that all people are very desirous to know them. This makes Plutarch's Lives be more generally

Read than any of all the Books which the ancient Greeks or Romans Writ.
But the lives of Hero's and Prin∣ces, are commonly filled with the account of the great things done by them, which do rather belong to a general, than a particular History; and do rather amuse the Reader's fancy with a splendid shew of great∣ness, than offer him what is really so useful to himself; And indeed the Lives of Princes are either Writ with so much flattery, by those who intended to merit by it at their own hands, or others concerned in them: Or with so much spite, by those who being ill used by them, have re∣venged themselves on their Memory, that there is not much to be built on them: And though the ill nature of many makes what is Satyrically writ to be generally more read and

believed, than when the flattery is visible and course, yet certainly Re∣sentment may make the Writer cor∣rupt the truth of History, as much as Interest: And since all Men have their blind sides, and commit Errors, he that will industriously lay these together, leaving out, or but slight∣ly touching what should be set a∣gainst them, to ballance them, may make a very good Man appear in very bad Colours: So upon the whole matter, there is not that reason to expect either much truth, or great instruction, from what is written con∣cerning Hero's or Princes; for few have been able to imitate the patterns Suetonius set the World in writing the Lives of the Roman Emperours, with the same freedom that they had led them: But the Lives of private Men, though they seldom entertain the Reader with such a variety of

passages as the other do; Yet cer∣tainly they offer him things that are more imitable, and do present Wis∣dom and Virtue to him, not only in a fair Idea, which is often look't on as a piece of the Invention or Fancy of the Writer, but in such plain and familiar instances, as do both direct him better, and per∣swade him more; And there are not such temptations to biass those who writ them, so that we may generally depend more on the truth of such re∣lations as are given in them.
In the age in which we live, Religion and Virtue have been proposed and de∣fended with such advantages, with that great▪ force of reason, and those perswasions, that they ca
