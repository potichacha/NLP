Epistle to the Reader.SIR, If this Writing be not accepta∣ble, here is already enough, and too much of it, but if it be, it is but a rough draught; for I have not been yet two years about it, nor ever saw all or halfe my Papers together: And now in the bringing them to light, they have been di∣spersed into three Presses, where because I could not be present at them all, I was present at none, by which means the weaknesse of my performance, hath been so strangely managed for the worse, that I am quite out of countenance at my worke, which the ensuing errors mended, will not be perfect, but not mended, is not to be understood: Wherefore let me intreat you before you cast away the time in beginning to read, that you mend the Faults according unto the ensuing Correstions: Which done, I dare promise you that if I have not made you a good flight, I have sprung you the best Quarry: For though the Discourses be full of crudi∣ties, the Modell hath had perfect concoction.
