SELF IMMOLATION; OR, THE SACRIFICE OF LOVE.

ACT I.

SCENE I.

A spacious and elegant Room, poorly furnished.

ARABELLA is employed in Needlework. Her MOTHER-IN-LAW, old and blind, is seated in an Arm-Chair, with her hands crossed on her Lap.
Mother.TOM!

Arab.What is your pleasure, dear mother?

Moth.Nothing particular, daughter; I want Tom▪

Arab.(Perplexed)
Tom—is ill.

Moth.Is he? Poor fellow!—Well, then, another may come.

Arab.Cannot I serve you?

Moth.If you please. I wish to have my breakfast, I have already asked three times for it.

Arab.Your breakfast—Yes, dear Mother.
(She lays down her work, and folds her hands with a deep sigh.)

Moth.Unless I have my tea and toast as soon as I rise in the morning—I am ill for the day. I have been ac|customed, these fifty years, to breakfast the moment I rise; and it does not look well, daughter, when an old blind woman is obliged to wait hours for a little hot water.

Arab.Excuse us, dear mother; Jane is gone for some bread; and you know, she is rather slow.

Moth.But why send Jane? Have we not other ser|vants in the house?

Arab.(Aside, with a sigh)
Yes, we had.
(Aloud)
We have lately endeavoured to do with fewer servants.

Moth.Very well; it is prudently done! When I was married, my late husband and I were very poor, indeed; and when my Robert, your husband, was born I put myself to many, many, little inconveniencies, that my child might want nothing. Now, it is your turn to make these sacrifices. When children are small, the mother should forego many of her wishes, to provide for their wants.

Arab.We do, with the utmost pleasure.

Moth.Do not take this amiss, daughter; but, I must say, that, for some time past, great disorder has prevailed in this house. Something or other is always wanting. I am blind; I cannot see—'tis true. Yet I can discern more than gives me pleasure.

Arab.My Robert, you know, has met with misfortunes in trade.

Moth.He has, child; but no merchant is always fortunate.

Arab.His loss from Belton's failure, was very great.

Moth.But Robert is not a Bankrupt.

Arab.(Aside with a sigh)
Ah, that you had spoken the truth!

Moth.His property was great: and though a part be lost, his mother's breakfast should not be wanting. I know my son: he will never forget, that, at the risk of my health 〈◊〉 supplied him myself with his first food. I was then sickly; yet
