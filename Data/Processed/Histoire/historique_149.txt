Fears and Jealousies Ceas'd: Or, an Impartial Discourse, tending to Demonstrate, from the Folly and ill Success of the Romish Poli∣ticks, that there is no Reason to Apprehend any Danger from Popery. In a Letter to a Friend.SIR,YOurs I receiv'd, and to my no small admiration, find that you still continue to stuff your Letters with the old Common place Dis∣courses of Fears and Jealousies, and of the Dangers we are in at present; but not content with this, you are pleas'd to give me a most Tragical Description of our future condition; How our Church is to be destroy'd, Protestants set together by the Ears, whilst our Popish Ene∣mies shall stand by, clap us on the back, spit in our mouths, and hearten us on to cut one anothers Throats: Who (as you say) when they shall be cloy'd with the Sport, will take the Sword out of our Hands, finish the Work we have so bravely begun, by dispatching those that remain; or at least, reducing them to submit to that heavy Yoak, which we see our Miserable Brethren of France groan under at this day.

Who cou'd imagine that our Government was safe, when we saw all those Prudent Laws which our Wise Ancestors were a making
 for above these hundred years, ready to be blown away at one blast? What Person cou'd be secure of his Birth-right, or Body Politick of its Rights and Priviledges, considering the havock that was lately made in our Corporations and Universities? These Considerations, I say, some small time ago, were able, no doubt, to Conjure up
