TO THE REVEREND AND HONOURABLE, THE VICE-CHANCELOUR And the Body of the CONVOCATION In the UNIVERSITY of OXFORD.HONOƲR'D SIRS,THough I am Confident I need not to refresh my former desires for the Election of the Master of the Rolls for one of the University Burgesses in the insuing Parliament, yet under∣standing the severe opposition against him, I must needs take leave to tell you, that I had never desired that favour either for my Selfe or any Other, had I not apprehended you as ready to grant it, as I was free and cheerefull to aske it: And I have reason yet to believe, that I could not so much mistake those Worthy persons, that gave Me a Tender herein, as to imagine a greater favour to my selfe, then they or you intended Mee. Gentlemen, it is really the desire of my Heart, to be an instrument in the hand of God, to doe good in my best Ser∣vices, both to your Selves, and the whole Nation, and had I known any Person more able and ready to assist in that Great Work, I had certainly with the same freedome proposed him: But you must give me leave to say, it was not Favour but Choyce, and that in order to the best Ends, that fixt and determined my Thoughts upon that Worthy Person; And therefore notwithstanding his Modesty, and selfe-deniall herein to mee, I take the freedome still to insist upon my first desires; your Condescention whereunto will oblige him to continue his Regards to You and the Whole Church, and much gratify
GENTLEMENYour very humble Servant G. Monke.
