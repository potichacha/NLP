THE inducements to the publication of the fol|lowing letter at this distant period, from the date of it, proceed from a hope entertained by some devout persons, who have been edified by the spiri|tual experiences it contains, that it may prove in|structive and comforting to others alike piously dis|posed, and to obviate the inconveniences to which manuscripts are liable, through the negligence and inattention of transcribers, incorrect copies having been handed about;â€”it has therefore been revised, and is now recommended to the serious perusal of those who having entered on a religious life, may find encouragement and instruction to press forward with stability and humble resignation, through the various probations and conflicts attending them in their christian progress, that they may obtain under their spiritual leader, the grace of God, the end of their faith, the salvation of their souls.
It may also be satisfactory to the readers, to have some account given of the writer, and the person to whom the letter was wrote, they are therefore briefly informed that Elizabeth Webb was an acknowledged minister among the people called Quakers, who from an apprehension of religious duty, and the con|straints of gospel love, went from Pennsylvania to Great Britain, to visit her friends there about the year 1712, and in London contracted some ac|quaintance with Anthony William Boehm, chaplain to prince George of Denmark, the consort of Ann, queen of England; he was by birth a German, but well acquainted with the English language, and died in the year 1722; the divers writings on religious subjects he has left, shew him to be a man of a truly pious and catholic disposition, which is also con|firmed by the testimonials given of him by men of character in that time, who from their personal knowledge, mention him with great respect for his piety to God, and benevolence to mankind.

What I have to write, hath been on my mind these several weeks, in that pure innocent love, in which is the communion of saints. I have no learned method to deliver my religious experience ei|ther by word or writing, but plainly and sim|ply as the spirit of truth directs, and I being the weaker vessel too, have the more need to beg to be excused.

they are many times unsound, but I shall write a small part
