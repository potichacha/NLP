Generoso, et cortese, vn nobil core.

¶TO THE READER.FOR SO MVCHE AS
(gentle Reader) Man
is not born to ye onely
profite, and pleasu∣ring
of him self alone
(as witnesseth TVLLIE.) But
parte of his birth, his Countrey
doth challeng: part his parents,
and part his frendes? I thought
good therfore, to offer vnto thy
attentiue and benevolent eares,
this present Historie: Wherin
thou maist see, the puissant force
of ragyng loue, and the mutaby∣lytie,
and fickle state of Fortune:
And so muche the rather, I haue
yelded this Historie into thy hā∣des,
for y• it is affirmed, of graue
and ancient Fathers, that a Hi∣storie
is to be esteemed & accomp∣ted,
as a moste cleare Glasse, for

imitacion, of ordering, and insti∣tution
of mannes life. Both to
yong men, that by reading of di∣uerse
things, are made equall in
wisdome, to their Elders: And
also to Aūcientes, whose cōtinu∣ance
of time ministreth experi∣ence
of many matters. More∣ouer,
that it maketh priuate
men, worthye of honour: forceth
•lowte, and valiant Captaynes,
(for emulation of glorie▪) to ac∣complish
inuincible exploites:
Encourageth Sowldiers to be
more prompt, and redy (for desire
of praise whiche neuer dieth) to
hazarde lyfe for the sauegarde of
their Countrey. And is a terrour
to wicked men to offend, for feare
of Infamie and reproche. For a
Historie is a Treasorer of Uali∣aunce,
and a witnesse against yll
doers. I craue not of thee any

hyre for my paynes (gentell Rea∣der)
but friendly acceptance, and
that thou would stoppe with an
Iron Barre, and Bolte of Brasse
the •elchyng Nosethrils of RHI∣NOCEROS
subtyll Snowte, and
his raging▪ furious •o wling, cō∣pesce,
and mitigate with perpen∣ded
Iudgement. And lastly, that
thy friendly worde, breathyng &
blowyng▪ a coole, & gentle blaste,
of Golden Ayre, maye happelie
yeld, vnto my first fruits, a calme
and fauourable winde.
Fare ye well.

¶Your Friend to vse. T. C.¶The Argument.LOe héere, the fierie force of loue,
redéemes the worthy wit,
From seruile yoake: beinge drownde in sincke
and stinkyng muddie pytie.
Beholde how Reason yeldes to loue,
and Uertue geueth place:
The Ruler, blinded by desire,
his noble fame deface.
And sée how wauering Fortune turnes,
with euery blast of winde:
First, gentle face, then frowning f•ets,
she cast• on longyng minde.
From lowryng lookes, to smilyng chéers
she eftsoones flittes againe:
The lingring louer thus shée féedes,
with hope his loue to gaine.
