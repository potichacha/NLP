TO LADY COCKBURNETHE FOLLOWING PAGES ARE MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED, AS A SMALL MARK OF THE GRATITUDE WHICH WILL EVER GLOW UNDIMINISHED (while life remains) IN THE BREAST OF HER LADYSHIP's MUCH HONOURED, OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT,
SUSAN ROWSON.THE PREFACE.I CANT for my life see the necessity of it, said I; there are numbers of books published without pre|faces.
But you do not consider, said my friend, that this book absolutely requires a preface—it is the adven|tures of a gentleman who possessed a magic ring: and seemingly those adventures are written by himself, but you give no account how they came into your hands?
Why they came into my hands through my brain, friend, said I.—These adventures are mere|ly the children of Fancy. I must own that the best part of them originated in facts.
But why do you make your Inquisitor a man? said he.

As to the motives that induced me to publish it, they can be of no consequence for the reader to be informed of, therefore they shall remain a secret.
But sure, said my friend, you will make some apo|logy for attempting to write in the style of the in|imitable Sterne?
Is the person required to make an apology who copies a portrait painted by an eminent master, said••; or should he fail of retaining in his copy, the fine strokes, the beautiful and striking expression in the features of the faultless original; is he to tear his picture, or commit it to the flames, because he has not the genius of the artist whose work he co|pied? Or, suppose a man admired his Sovereign's exalted virtues, and with a laudable ambition strov• to imitate them; is he, because he is conscious of not having the abilities to shine in the most eminent degree, not to endeavour to imitate them at a
