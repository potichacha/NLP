To the Right Honourable the Lords spiritual and temporal, and to the Honourable the knights, citizens, and burgesses in this present Parliament assembled, the humble petition of Titvs Oates, D.D.


To the Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, And to the Honourable The KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, and BURGESSES In this present PARLIAMENT Assembled; 
The Humble PETITION of TITƲS OATES, D. D.Most Humbly sheweth,THAT your Petitioner in the Year 1678, discovered a horrid Popish Conspiracy for the Destruction of the late King Charles the Second, his present Majesty, and the Protestant Religion within these Kingdoms; and prov'd it so fully, that several Parliaments, and Courts of Justice, before whom he gave his Testimony, de∣clared their Belief of it by publick Votes, and the Condemnation of several of the Conspirators. For which Rea∣son and because your Petitioner would not be terrified by their Threats, nor seduced by their Promises of great Rewards (with both which Temptations they often assaulted him) to desist in his Discovery; the Jesuits and Papists pursued him with an implacable Malice, and endeavoured to take away his Fame and Life, by suborning Witnesses to accuse him of Capital Crimes; but being defeated in that Villanous Attempt, they first procured King Charles the Second to withdraw that Protection and Subsistence his Majesty had, at the Request of several Parliaments, allowed to your Petitioner; and then instigated his Royal Highness the Duke of York to prosecute your Petitioner in an Action of Scandalum Magnatum, for speaking this notorious Truth, viz.
