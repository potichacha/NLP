INSCRIBED TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE PATRON OF LIBERTY, THE LAWS, AND THE FINE ARTS,
BY HIS MOST HUMBLE, AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT, BLANCHARD.INTRODUCTION.HAVING so happily succeeded in the 45th attempt of my aerial flight, in the presence of the enlightened citizens of Philadelphia, I thought I could still afford them some pleasure, by offering to them an accurate description of the operations prepa|ratory to this ascension, and by acquainting them with my various situation during this excursion, as well as with the motives which induced me to a return, and the means I made use of to accomplish it.

I then thought of terminating my aerial ex|cursions; and recalling to my mind my original situation, I wished to devote in a peaceable retreat the most precious moments of my leisure to col|lecting together my aerological observations, in order to offer them as fresh food to the eager thirst of mankind after new sources of knowledge.
THIS first intention of mine was soon altered by an uneasy emotion which seized my breast. The New World, so interesting by i
