THE MEANS OF ESTABLISHING PUBLIC HAPPINESS.ISAIAH xxxiii.6.AND WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE SHALL BE THE STABILITY OF THY TIMES.
TO establish on firm foundations the Happiness of Society is evidently one of the most important concerns of man. If the attainment of that happiness be highly desirable, the perpetuation of it must be more desirable. Its daily value is daily renewed, during its continuance; and, when extended through a century, it is mathematically proved to be of a hundred times the value, which it would possess, if extended only through a year.
The mind of man, instinctively realizing this truth, has ever laboured rather to secure, than to obtain, hap|piness, both public and private. The attainment is usually not a difficult task, the establishment a Hercu|lean one. A free government has been always, and justly, supposed to be a primary source of national hap|piness. To form such a government has been found sufficiently easy; but to render it durable has been ever considered as a problem of very difficult solution. Yet in its durability plainly consists almost all the value of such a government. Hence most of the political know|ledge and labour of freemen has been employed, and exhausted, in endeavouring to give stability to their re|spective

political systems. Hence have arisen the nu|merous checks, balances, and divisions of power and influence, found in our own political constitutions, and in those of several other nations. In other nations, these means have been generally insufficient to accomplish the end. Whether they will issue more happily in our own is uncertain. In several instances, we seem to have approached the verge of dissolution; but we have providentially withdrawn, before the season of safety was passed. Men of extensive political information, and sagacious forecast, have frequently trembled for our na|tional existence; and, notwithstanding some favourable interpositions of Providence in our behalf, they still wait anxiously to know what the end will
