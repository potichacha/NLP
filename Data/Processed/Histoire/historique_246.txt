An account of some proceedings, lately made, for an effectual prohibition of the exportation of wooll, &c. recommended to the woollen manufacturers of this kingdome.


AN ACCOUNT Of some Proceedings, lately made, for an Effectual Prohibition of the EXPORTA∣TION of WOOLL, &c. Recommended to the WOOLLEN MANU∣FACTURERS •f this KINGDOME.FRANCIS MONK, and others, ha∣ving made several Attempts to obtein a Commission, to Empower them to put in Execution the Laws for Prohibiting the Exportation of WOOL &c. Petitioned the Late King of Blessed Memory to that end, the Consideration whereof was referred to the Right Honourable the Lords of the Committee of Trade, who made their Re∣port thereupon, which, together with the said Petition by Order of Council, was referred to the Right Honourable the Lords of the
 Treasury; and their Lordships, for their better Information, referred the Matter, with the said Monk's Proposal and Papers, to the Attorney General, to the Commissioners of the Customs, and the Hamburgh Company; who ha∣ving severally made their Respective Re∣ports, the said Proposers not being recommended thereby, as Persons fitting for so great an undertaking, their Project took no effect.
And in regard, some of the said Proposers, in former Sessions of Parliament, had endeavou∣red to set on foot new Bills, to alter and abate the Penalties of the Laws, already made, to Prohibit the said Exportation; it was doubt∣ed, whether they were Persons qualified for a hearty carrying on the pretended Prohibition.
Therefore, in July 1684, Benjamin Craker, Charles Craker, and Joseph Reeve, Staplers, William Brewer, John Wood, John Walkley, Richard Scott, Thomas Smale, Thomas Crundal and seve∣ral others, Clothiers and Factors, hearing of the Attempt of the said Monk and his Partners, Petitioned the Lords of the Treasury, setting
 forth, that the said Proposal (if honestly in∣tended) being of great Moment, and univer∣sal Concern to the Kingdome, was not fitting to be trusted in the hands of such (or any) pri∣vate Persons; and therefore pray'd their Lord∣ships to recommend the same to the Hambo∣rough, East-India, Turkey, African, Russia, and East∣land Companies, and other general Woollen Traders, of whose Prudence and Integrity there could be no suspition, to consider the said Pro∣posals, and to report to their Lordships such Rules and Methods, as they thought sit, for the Effectual putting the said Lawes in Execu∣tion.
In answer to which Petition, the Right Ho∣nourable the Lords of the Treasury, by their Letters to the said several Companies, of the 25 of July 1684; taking notice that the effectual Prohibition of the Exportation of WOOLL would be of great advantage, not only to his Majesty, but all his Trading Subjects, Transmit∣ting also a Copy of the said Propo∣sal and Papers, desired the said Compa∣nies, or some Members by them Deputed, to meet together, to consider the said Papers, and
 report such rules and methods, for putting the said Prohibition in execution,
