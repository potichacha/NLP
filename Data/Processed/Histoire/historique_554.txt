❧ By the King.❧ A Proclamation for reuocation of Mariners from forreine Seruices.WHereas within this short time since the Peace concluded be∣tweene Vs and the King of Spaine and the Archdukes our good Brothers, it hath appeared vnto Vs that many Mariners and Sea∣faring men of this Realme, hauing gotten a custome and habite in the time of the Warre to make profite by Spoile, doe leaue their ordinary and honest vocation and Trading in Merchantly Voyages, whereby they might both reape conuenient maintenance, and be seruiceable to their Countrey, And doe betake themselues to the Seruice of diuers forreine States, vnder the Title of men of Warre, to haue thereby occasion to continue their vnlawfull and vngodly course of liuing by Spoile, vsing the seruice of those Princes but for co∣lour and pretext, but in effect making themselues commonly no better then Pirats to robbe both our owne Subiects their Countreymen, and the Subiects of other Princes our neighbours, going in their honest Trade of Merchandize: By which courses they doe impeach the quiet Traffique of Nations one with other, leaue our Realme vnfurnished of men of their sort, if we should haue cause to vse them, and inure themselues to an impious disposition of liuing by ra∣pine and euill meanes, although by reason of the Vniuersall Peace wherein we are at this pre∣sent with all Christian Princes and States, they may haue a more plentifull employment in an orderly and lawfull Nauigation, then at any time of late yeeres they could haue had: We haue thought it necessarie in time to preuent the spreading of such a corruption amongst our Subiects of that sort and calling, whereby our Nation will bee so much slandered, and our Realme so greatly disaduantaged. Wherefore wee doe will and command all Masters of Ships, Pilots, Mariners, and all other sort of Seafaring men, who now are in the Martiall seruice of any for∣reine States, that they doe presently returne home into their owne Countrey, and leaue all such forreine Seruices, and betake themselues to their Vocation in the lawfull course of Merchan∣dize, and other orderly Nauigation, vpon such paines and punishments as by the Lawes of our Realme may be inflicted vpon them, if after this declaration of our Pleasure, they shall not obey. And we doe also vpon the same paines straightly charge and command all our Subiects of that profession, that none of them shal from henceforth take Letters of Marke or Reprisall, nor serue vnder any that hath such letters of Marke or Reprisall from any forreine Prince or State what∣soeuer, Nor otherwise employ themselues in any warlike Seruices of any forraine State vpon the Sea, without speciall License obtained from our Selfe, or from our high Admirall, as they will answere the contrarie at their perils.
And forasmuch as although wee are in Peace with all Christian Princes and States, yet du∣ring the continuance of the Warre betweene the King of S
