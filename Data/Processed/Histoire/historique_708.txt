☞To the christen reader.LO Christen re¦der, whyle the worlde not slū¦bred, but rou∣ted. and snor∣ted in the depe and dead slepe of ygnorauncye, some lyuelye spirites were wakynge, and ceased not to calle vppon the drousye mul•itude of men, and to styrre them vp frō the longe dreames of synfull lyuynge, that ones at the last they wold crepe out of darkenesse, & come forth to the hote shynyng sūne of goddes worde, that both the fylthie mystes of theyr hartes myghte be driuen awaye, and also theyr heuye and dy•nge spirites recreated, refresshed,

and quyckened. So that no man can alledge that in anye age there wanted preachers of goddes worde. For he that ke∣peth Israell slepeth not, ne slō∣breth. And thoughe thorow his secrete counsayle, he sendethe more labourers into his har∣ueste at one tyme then at ano∣ther, yet he hathe euer some to wede, to reape to gether sheues togither in to the barnes of euerlastyng lyfe. Read therfore diligently this lytle sermon so longe sithens written, and thou shalte perceyue the same quicke spirite in the authoure therof, that thou nowe meruei¦lest at in other of oure tyme.
He sharply, ernestlye. and wyt∣tely rebuketh the synnes of all sortes of men, and speaketh as one hauynge auctorytye, and as the scrybes, and pharisees, whiche with theyr leaded, and

blunt dartes could neuer touch the quycke, thoughe they haue occupied, and worne the pul∣pettes so many yeares. The worde of God is lyuelye, and mighty in operation, and shar∣per then any two edged swerde and cuteeth euen vnto the dy∣uision of the soule, and of the spirite, and of the ioyntures, and mary. &c. wherfore ef•sones I exhorte the to reade thys ly∣tle treatise diligently, and not onelye to reuerence antiquitie, and the lyuely spirite, and worde of God therin, but also to lerne, bothe to ac∣know∣ledge and more ouer to a∣mende the wyc∣kednes of thy lyfe.
Redde rtionem uilli∣cationis tuaeLuce. xvi.CHriste the authour and doctoure of all truth. in hys gospel, lykeneth the kyngedome of heauen, to a housholder, sayeng on this wyse. Lyke is the kyngedome of heauen to a houssholdynge man, that wente forth fyrste in the mornynge, to hyre worke∣men into hys vyneyarde, so dyd he about the thyrde houre the syxte / the nynthe, and the eleuēth. And as he founde men standyng ydle, he sayed to them why stand ye here vnoccupied, Go ye into my vyneyarde and that, that is dewetye, I shall gyue you.
