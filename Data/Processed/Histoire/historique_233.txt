Good Counsell, to the Petitioners for Presbyterian Government, That they may declare their Faith before they build their Church.THe Saints of God being separated from Idolatry, and joyned together in the fellowship of the Gospel, have ever enjoyed commission from Christ to practise all the parts of Gods true Religion, and also to keep the Ordinances of God from contempt or profanation amongst themselves. And this power they have from God though with persecution, now, in this time of Parliament. Persecution, I say, not from the Parliament, (further then they neglect to preserve their peace according to the Law of God) but persecution, as it arose from the Pope, and Bishops in former time primarily; so would it do now from their sons, who call themselves Divines, yea, even in the height of it, if they might have their wils, as appeareth by their late Petition, for which there was a pub∣lick calling out for hands.
Well was it with the Kings of Israel when they took the counsell of Gods true Prophets though few in number, but such a Clergy which is naturally addicted to perse∣cution cannot be a blessing to any Parliament or Nation, as appeareth by the Scripture. And therefore my desire is, that the Parliament may submit to God for direction and counsell, even to beware of men, especially of false Prophets, or any evill workers whatever they be; And that all persons fearing God, in the City of London, or else∣where, may blesse God, for fulfilling his promises unto them, that their eyes enjoy their Teachers, though in an upper roome, as Christ and his Apostles met.

They bewail that the children should come so neer to the birth, and that there is no strength to bring forth: But I think the children are sufficiently brought forth unto them. If their means be established upon them, by the Parliament (as I am informed it is for a certain time:) for I know no other Children they mean, but two: viz: MAINTENANCE and POWER: The one they have as Saul had the fat cattell, contrary to Gods commandment: The other they shall never have: for God will fight against such as fight for them, as it ap∣pears at this day: for they by usurped power ever shed the blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jesus, and now God is making inquisition for the blood which hath been spilt, and the more fiercely they go o
