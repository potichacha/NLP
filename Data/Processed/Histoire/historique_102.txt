SEASONABLE MOTIVES.To our DUTY and ALLEGIANCE, (by a Lover of the Peace of New-England) offer'd to the Consideration of his Neighbours & Country-men.WHat were the grounds and in|ducements that moved us to seize on the Governour and other principall Persons con|cerned in the Government under King James, and that we unanimously declared for the Prince of Orange shall not need here to be mentioned, I'm sure our Intention was never to depart from our Loyalty & Allegiance to the Crown of England, which now since it hath pleased God to place on the Heads of our Soveraign Lord and Lady, King William and Queen Mary, who are owned & proclaimed as such thro' out all their Majesties Kingdomes, Territories & Domi|nions, and perticularly by us; we are the more firmly obleiged to testify and bear Obedience to them in the best and most dutifull manner we can.
