To the most Illustrious and most Excellent PRINCE, CHARLES, Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, Earl of Chester, &c.It may Please Your Highness,IN part of my acknowledgment to Your Highness, I have en∣deavoured to do Honour to the Memory of the last King of Eng∣land, that was Ancestour to the King your Father, and Your self; and was that King to whom both Unions may in a sort refer: That of the Roses being in him Con∣summate, and that of the Kingdoms by him begun. Besides, his times deserve it. For he was a Wise Man, and an Excellent King; and yet the times were rough, and full of Mutations and rare Accidents. And it is with Times, as it is with Ways. Some are

more Vp-hill and Down-hill, and some are more Flat and Plain; and the One is better for the Liver, and the Other for the Writer. I have not flattered him, but took him to life as well as I could, sitting so far off, and having no better light. It is true, Your High∣ness hath a Living Pattern, Incomparable, of the King Your Father. But it is not amiss for You also to see one of these Ancient Pieces. GOD preserve Your Highness.
Your Highness most humble and devoted Servant,
