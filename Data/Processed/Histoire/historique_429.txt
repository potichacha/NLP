THE PREFACE.I QUITE agree with those who think ministers ought not to bring into the pulpit dry specula|tions, or dark abstruse, disputed points, which have no tendency to make the heart better, and influence the practice: But shall be far from agreeing with any, who may think the subject of the fol•owing sermons to be such.—If God has given us sufficient evi|dence to determine, that all the sin and misery in the universe is for the general good of the whole, and shall answer some good end that shall much more than counter-balance the evil; then doubtless it is of importance, that all should attend to the evidence, and believe this truth.
It is, I conceive, evident beyond contradiction, that this truth must be believed in order to a true and chearful submission to God's will, as it is manifested in what he does and what he permits. For he who chearfully submits to God's will, submits to it as WISE and GOOD, either seeing it to be so in the in|stance his submission respects, or believing it implicit|ly: For it is not our duty, or indeed possible for us to be reconciled or submit to absolute evil, or evil as such. But if the sin and misery which take place in the world, are not for the general good of the uni|verse, then they are absolutely evil, or evil in every view and sense; and so God's will to permit sin and misery is not WISE and GOOD, and therefore cannot be submitted to.

"THAT THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE EVIL IN THE UNIVERSE,"
 is a maxim on which is grounded all implicit submission to God's will, in his p
