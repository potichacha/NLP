TO
The most August
CHARLES
THE SECOND,
King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender
of the Faith, &c.Dread Sovereign,HERE is a Firmament of Stars, that
shine not without your Benign Beam;
you are the Sun of our Hemisphere that
sets a splendour on the Nobility: For
as they are Jewels and Ornaments to
your Crown, so they derive their lustre and value from thence:
From your Breast, as from a Fountain, the young Plants of

Honour are cherisht and nurst up. Your vertuous Atchieve∣ments
are their Warrant and Example, and your Bounty the
Guerdon of their Merit. And as all the Roman Emperours
after Julius Caesar, were desirous to be called Imperatores
& Caesares, from him; so shall all succeeding Princes, in
this our Albion (in emulation of your Vertues) be ambitious
to bear your Name to Eternity.
Deign then (Great Sir) a gracious Reflex upon, and Ac∣ceptation
of this Display of Heraldry, which though in it
self is excellent, yet thus illustrated by your Name, will ad∣mit
of no Comparison, but render to the Publisher a share of
Honour, in that he is permitted into your Presence:
Being
In all humility,
Your Majesties most
submissive and obedient
Subject and Servant,
