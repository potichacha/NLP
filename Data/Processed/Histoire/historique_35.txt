SERMON, I. Shewing the Vertue of CHRISTS Blood to Cleanse from Sin.I. Epistle of JOHN, I.7. last part.â€” And the Blood of Jesus Christ|his Son cleanseth us from all Sin.
IN these Words we have the com|mendation of the blood of Christ. By the blood of Christ we are not to un|derstand the natural blood of Christ: if a Man had kept some Ounces of that when it ran out of his side, it would have done him no good: but the meaning is, the Sufferings of Christ, especially his bloody death. The commendation of it is, (1.) That it has an Efficacy to cleanse us from Sin. Sin is a pollution and stain: it renders Men offensive to God, it makes them filthy in the Eye of God; it exposes them to
Gods wrath: but the blood of Christ clean|seth us: Rev. 1.5. Jesus Christ washeth us from our sins in his own blood. (2.) The greatness of the efficacy: it cleanseth away all sin. Some Sins are of a double die, scar|let Sins; some have committed a Multitude of Sins, and nothing else can cleanse from any one Sin, but this cleanseth from all.

This begets a great deal of disquietment in the hearts of some Men, they would gladly be put into a way to be deli|vered from the guilt of Sin; they have tryed some methods and they don't effect the thing, Prayers and Tears will not do; but this Doctrine gives an account what will do: There is vertue in the blood of Christ to do it. Some things have a tendency to work this and that Effect, but they are not always
powerful; but there is worth enough in the blood of Christ to take away Sin. Other things are no ransom for the Soul; but they that have an interest in the blood of Christ are delivered from the guilt of Sin. It is all one whether Mens Sins be more or s
