To the Courteous Reader.COurteous, Kind, & indifferent Readers, whose wil∣lingnesse
to reade & heare this following discourse,
doth explaine to the world your hearty affection,
to the prosecuting and furtherance of so worthy an acti∣on:
so it is, that like to an vnskilfull actor, who hauing
by misconstruction of his right Cue, ouer-slipt him∣selfe,
in beginning of a contrary part, and fearing the
hatefull hisse of the captious multitude, with a modest
blush retires himselfe in priuate; as doubting the repre∣hension
of his whole audience in publicke, and yet a∣gaine
vpon further deliberation, thinking it better to
know their censures at the first, and vpon submission to
reape pardon, then by seeking to smother it, to incurre
the danger of a secret scandall: Imboldening himselfe
vpon the curteous kindnesse of the best, and not greatly
respecting the worst, comes fourth againe, makes an A∣pollogie
for himselfe, shewes the cause of his error,
craues pardon for his rashnes, and in fine, receiues a ge∣nerall
applauditie of the whole assemblie: so I gentle
Readers, happening vpon this relation by chance (as I
take it, at the second or third hand) induced thereunto
by diuers well willers of the action, and none wishing
better towards it then my selfe, so farre foorth as my
poore abilitie can or may stretch too, I thought good to
publish it: but the Author being absent from the presse,
it cannot be doubted but that some faults haue escaped
in the printing, especially in the names of Countries,

Townes, and People, which are somewhat strange vnto
vs: but most of all, and which is the chiefe error, (for
want of knowledge of the Writer) some of the bookes
were printed vnder the name of Thomas Watson, by
whose occasion I know not, vnlesse it were the ouer rash∣nesse,
or mistaking of the workemen, but since hauing
learned that the saide discourse was written by Captaine
Smith, who is one of the Counsell there in Virginia: I
thought good to make the like Apollogie, by shewing
the true Author so farre as my selfe could learne, not
doubting, but that the wise noting it as an error of igno∣rance,
will passe it ouer with patience, and if worthy an
applauditie, to reserue it to the Author, whose paines in
my
