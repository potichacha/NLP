A DISCOURSE, ON THE GENUINENESS AND AUTHENTICITY OF THE NEW-TESTAMENT: DELIVERED AT NEW-HAVEN, SEPTEMBER 10th, 1793, AT THE ANNUAL LECTURE, APPOINTED BY THE GENERAL ASSOCIATION OF CONNECTICUT; ON THE TUESDAY BEFORE THE PUBLIC COMMENCEMENT.
NEW-YORK: PRINTED BY GEORGE BUNCE, & Co M,DCC,XCIV.
ADVERTISEMENT.THE testimony, adduced in the following discourse, was taken principally from Dr. Lardner's Credibility of the Gospel Histo|ry. Several other valuable articles of testimo|ny, collected with an intention to insert them, were omitted, on account of the length of the discourse; as were also some additional argu|ments.
A little more than half of what is now pub|lished was delivered from the desk. If the writer is not deceived, the remainder will be found to be pertinent to the principal design. He believes the testimony to be justly represent|ed; but, if in the hurry and anxiety, occasion|ed by a long continued sickness of his family, and of his parishioners, any mistakes have been committed, he presumes they will be pardoned.

A DISCOURSE ON THE GENUINENESS AND AUTHENTICITY OF THE NEW-TESTAMENT.JOHN XXI. 24.This is the Disciple, who testifieth these things, and wrote these things; and we know, that his testimony is true.THIS passage asserts the book, in which it is found to have been truly written by St. John. Should the assertion be fair|ly proved by the highest evidence, applica|ble to subjects of this nature, the Genuine|ness and Authenticity of the whole New|Testament would, probably, be, by most persons, acknowledged to be also proved. As the gospel of St. John contains Narra|tions, and Doctrines, as surprising and im|probable, as any which are contained in the other books of the New-Testament; as the admission of these will be generally al|lowed to be an admission of those also, and

will involve difficulties, in the eye of human faith, of the same nature, and the same magnitude; and as the same evidence will support both alike, few persons, who are wholly persuaded, that the gospel, attribu|ted to St. John, was written, and truly writ|ten, by him, will hesitate to receive the whole New-Testament as an authentic ac|count of the life, death, and resurrection, the instructions, ins
