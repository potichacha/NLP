 [illustration]  [Royal blazon or coat of arms.] ❧ A Proclamation for reliefe of the poore, and remedying the high prices of Corne.THE Kings most Excellent Maiestie, hauing taken knowledge of the present scarcity and dearth, and of the high prices of Corne and graine throughout all parts of this Kingdome, hath beene pleased by his Procla∣mation lately published, to restraine the residence of the Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and of the Knights, and Gentlemen of quality, in, and neere the Cities of London and Westminster, and other Cities and Townes, and to returne them vnto their owne houses & habitations in their seuerall Countries, that all partes of the Kingdome might finde the fruites, and feele the comfort of their hospitality and good gouernment: wherein, as His Maiestie is well pleased with the dutifull obedience of great numbers, that according to His Royall command, haue left the Cities of London and Westminster, and the parts adiacent; So His Highnesse hath great cause to con∣demne the obstinacy of all such, as in a time of such generall conformity, and against so many good examples, shall shew themselues refractorie to that His Royall pleasure, grounded vpon important reasons of Iustice and State. And therefore His Maiestie doeth eftsoones admonish them spee∣dily to submit themselues to that His Royall Proclamation, or else to expect the seuerity of His iustice for their wilfull contempt. And this His Maiestie declares to be extended, aswell vnto such as haue repayred, or shall repayre from their ordinary dwellings in the Countrey, vnto other Cities and Townes, as vnto the Cities of London and Westminster, and aswell vnto Widdowes, as men of qua∣lity and estate, and to be continued, not only during the time of Christmasse now instant, but in that, and in all other times and seasons of this and other yeeres, vntill His Maiestie declare His pleasure other∣wise, His Maiestie intending to continue this course heereafter, for the generall good of His people: Yet allowing that Liberty which alwayes hath beene in Termes, and otherwise, to repayre to Lon∣don about their necessary occasions, but not to remooue their wiues and families from their ordinary habitations in the Countrey: An innouation and abuse lately crept in, and growne frequent.
And although His Maiestie is perswaded that by this way of reuiuing the laudable and ancient housekeeping of this Realme, the poore, and such as are most pinched in times of scarcity and want, will be much releeued and comforted; yet that nothing may be omitted that may tend to their succour and helpe, His Highnesse in His gracious and Princely care and prouidence, hath caused certaine po∣litique & good orders, heeretofore made vpon like occasion, to be reuiued & published, intituled, Orders appointed by His Maiestie, &c. By which the Iustices of Peace in all partes of the Realme are directed t
