A proclamation for a public thanksgiving. ... Thursday the twenty-third day of November instant ... Given under our hands at the Council-chamber, in Watertown, this fourth day of November ...


A PROCLAMATION FOR A PUBLIC THANKSGIVING.ALTHO' in Consequence of the unnatural, cruel, andbarbarous Measures, adopted and pursued by the British Administration, great and distressing Calamities are brought upon our oppressed Country, and on this Colony in particular; we feel the dreadful Effects of Civil War, by which America is stained with the Blood of her valiant Sons, who have bravely fallen in the laudable Defence of our Rights and Priviledges;—Our Capital, once the Seat of Justice, Opulence and Virtue, is unjustly wrested from its proper Owners, who are obliged to flee from the Iron Hand of Tyranny, or are held in the unrelenting Arms of Oppression:—Our Sea-Ports greatly distressed, and Towns burnt by the Foes, who have acted the Part of barbarous Incendiaries.—And altho' the wise and holy Governor of the World, has, in his righteous Providence, sent Droughts into this Colony, and wasting Sickness into many of our Towns; yet we have the greatest Reason to adore and praise the Supreme Disposer of Events, who deals infinitely better with us than we deserve; and amidst all his Iudg|ments hath remembered Mercy, by causing the Voice of Health again to be heard amongst us;—Instead of Famine, affording to an ungrateful People a Competency of the Necessaries and Comforts of Life; in remar|kably preserving and protecting our Troops, when in apparent Danger, while our  Enemies, with all their boas•ed Skill and Strength, have met with Loss, Disappointment, and Defeat;— and in the Course of his good Providence, the Father of Mercies hath bestowed upon us, many other Favours, which call for our grateful Acknowledgements.
Therefore,
WE have thought fit, with the Advice of the C•uncil and House of Representatives, to appoint THURSDAY the Twenty-third Day of November Instant, to be observed as a Day of public THANKSGIVING, throughout this Colony; hereby calling upon Ministers and People, to meet for religious Worship on said Day, and devoutly to offer up their unfeigned Praises to Almighty GOD, the Source and benevolent Bestower of all Good, for his affording the necessary Means of Subsistance, tho' our Commerce has been prevented, and the Supplies from the Fishery denied us.—That such a Measure of Health is enjoyed among us; that the Lives of our Officers and Soldiers have been so remarkably preserved, whi•e our Enemies have fell before them:—That the vigorous Efforts which have been used to excite the Savage Vengeance of the Wilderness, and rouse the Indians to Arms, that an unavoidable Destruc•ion might come upon our Frontiers, have been almost miraculously defeated:—That our unnatural Enemies, instead of Ravaging the Country with uncontrouled Sway, are confined within such narrow Limits, to their own Mortification and Distress, environed by an American Army, br
