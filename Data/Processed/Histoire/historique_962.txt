TO HIS
SARED MAJESTY
HARLES the Seond,
King of Gret-B•ittin,
Frne nd Irelnd.Most Grious Soverigne;I Hope this Dedition of
these my olletions on∣erning
ll the Kings of
Englnd to your Sred
Mjesty, from the first of
them (of whom there is ny
thing redile in story) to the deese of
your Royll Fther, will not e interpreted
either  fruit of mition or over-old
presumption. I hve hd the honour for∣merly
to dedite Books to very eminent
Soieties nd Persons, ut never to ny so
signlly eminent nd pulike  Person s
your Mjesty. And should not hve tken
the onfidene to hve egun now, ut tht
(in regrd of the Argument I tret of)
I thought there ws n oligtion upon
me; nd tht of right suh  Work ws to
e presented onely to Him, who is the just

nd unquestionle Suessour to ll those
Kings I here mention. I finde it usull with
those who either wrote hroniles in ge∣nerll,
or the reigns of some prtiulr Prin∣es,
to insrie the Nme of the King or
Prine then living to their Works. I wish
my Oservtions were s hoie, s the
sujet is sutle. Sine dwllder, the
lst King of the Britins, there ws none
orn Prine of Gret-Britin ut your Mjesty.
Htenus Anglorum nulli ws there∣fore
the Motto on the Medls mde in me∣mory
of your Birth-dy the 29th of My
1630, with three Lurels upon them e∣tokening
three Kingdoms. My your rign
e s prosperous nd hppy, s your irth
ws glorious nd illustrious; your deli∣verne
y Se t your entrne into Sot∣lnd,
nd your espe y Lnd t Worester-fight,
nd fter in Englnd; nd your hp∣py
restitution to your Kingdom, ws won∣derfull
nd onspiuous. Kings hve their
regl Titles nd Ornments. To the
Kings of Spin from the time of Alphonsus
King of stile, out 800 yers goe, for
expelling the Arins, ws given the Title
of tholike, s Mihel Ritius  Nepoli∣tn
writeth. To the Frenh King the Title

of most hristin from the time of Philip
the Emperour, out 400 yers sine, s
reordeth Niol, Gillius. To our King
Henry the 8th of Englnd for his Book of
the Srments ginst Luther, Pope Leo
the 10th gve the Title, Defender of the
Fith, whih his Suessors hve sine
enjoyed, though in nother sense thn it
ws first intended. Henry the 5th reigning
mongst us, his Sujets gve him the Ti∣tle
of Gre. Under Henry the Sint, the
6th, Exellent ws dded to Gre: Under
Henry the 8th the lmtion of Mjesty
egn;  little fter exellent Mjesty, most
exellent, nd t lst Sred Mjesty, whih
now is generlly used.
 Kings re rowned, enthronized, nd
nointed; the rown ws  sign of  Mili∣try
dominion; t
