 [illustration] CRDIEV ET MON DROIT〈◊◊〉 QVI·MAL·Y·PENSE [royal blazon or coat of arms] By the King.A PROCLAMATION For calling Home such of His Majesties Subjects as are now abroad in the Dominions or Service of His Majesties Enemies.CHARLES R.ALthough His Majesties late Declaration of War, against the States of the United Provinces, be in it self a sufficient Warning to all His Maje∣sties Subjects, now inhabiting in any part of the Dominions of the U∣nited Provinces, or employed in the Service of the States General, to with∣draw themselves with all possible speed, least they incur the dangers of the Law in being found to have adhered to His Majesties Enemies. Yet because it is possible that some of His Majesties good Subjects now remaining in those parts may neither know the hazards they run by continuing there, nor the advantages they shall Receive by an early and useful re∣turning into His Majesties Service; His Majesty therefore by advice of His Council hath thought fit to Declare His Royal Will and Pleasure, and doth hereby require and command all and every of His Subjects now living within the Dominions of the States of the United Provinces, or any way employed in their Service, That they do return Home with all convenient speed, upon pain of being proceeded against, according to the utmost rigour of Law for such their Treasonable adherence, and of ineurring the Loss and For∣feiture of all their Lands, Tenements, Goods, and Chattels, which shall be found in any of his Majesties Realms. And if any of His Majesties Subjects who have heretofore fled from His Majesties displeasure, and are now remaining in those parts, shall be desirous to deserve His Majesties Grace and Favour hereafter, by performing to His Majesty any ac∣ceptable and signal Service, His Majesty doth hereby Declare, That such person shall not onely be received to Pardon, whatsoever his former Crimes were, but shall also at his re∣turn receive from His Majesty a Gracious and very ample Reward of such His Service.
Given at the Court at Whitehallthe 29th day of March 1672. In the 24th year of His Majesties Reign.
