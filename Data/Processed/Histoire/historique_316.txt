FRIENDS,THis following Epistle being committed to me,
I have found it convenient to disperse it on
this wise to the Churches of Christ, for whose
service chiefly it hath been written as I perceive; and
this being a time, wherein each Friend in God ought
to serve another, and to be a strength and encou∣ragement
one towards another in the Wayes of God,
and therefore according to my duty, wherein I stand
bound to the lord and his Servants, I have diligent∣ly
endeavoured your benefit and edification in send∣ing
this unto you, who accounts it my greatest ho∣nour
to serve the Lord and his Servants.
Ellis Hookes.To the Beloved Church of God that have believed and
received the Testimony of our Lord Iesus Christ;
The true Light that Lighteth every man that com∣eth
into the World.IN the Name and Power of our Lord Jesus
Christ blessed for ever, that tender Salutati∣ons
of my immortal Life is daily abounding
towards, you, who are the true Flock of the
Fathers Love and Care, who hath begotten you
to himself by his Word that lives for ever in us
and with us, that ye should be a People Chosen
and Elected of him unto eternal blessings, and to
be a Praise and an Honour to him throughout
the World, by and through the virtue of his
Life and Power, and in the fruits of his Spirit
brought forth by you all, who are the only Chil∣dren
of that birth which is only the Lords.
Well dearly Beloved, my heart at this time is
filled in the Fathers Love, with the dear Remem∣brance
of you whom the Lord hath gathered
with his Arm of power, and in his Spirit do I desire
the encrease of all mercies, and peace, and bles∣sings
unto you, that you may be rich and strong,
and wise and mighty through the Lord Jesus
Christ, and receiving daily of his grace, may e∣ver
be preserved, constant and faithful in the
heavenly calling unto the end; And forasmuch
as the Lord hath began his glorious work in the
midst of you, and gathered you out of the dark∣nesse,
and ignorance, and unbelief of this World,

where sometime your converse hath been, while
ye knew not the Lord, and raised you up into
the Light, and Power and Wisdome of the Lord
Jesus Christ, having largely tasted of the same
in the experience of his leadings through diverse
Operations and Manifestations of his Spirit, so
that many of you have attained to a good mea∣sure
to peace and rest with the Lord in your in∣ward
man; Dearly Beloved, seeing it is thus,
these things the Spirit of the Father in me travel∣eth
to bring
