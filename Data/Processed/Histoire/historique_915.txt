who were the uniform of an officer of Yeomanry Cavalry, rose, amid cheers, to move ""That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty for her Gracious Speech from the Throne. ""
He said: I have to crave the indulgence of your Lordships for the position in which I find myself, for not only is this the first time I have had the honour of addressing your Lordships, but I believe I might count myself the youngest Member of the House, this being the first occasion on which I have had the privilege of occupying my seat on these Benches.
I trust I shall not be transgressing any unwritten laws or traditions if I venture to refer to a subject which naturally has found no place in the Gracious Speech from the Throne.
