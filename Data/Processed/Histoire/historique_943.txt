Psal. 116.To The Reader.GRace and peace / &c. Good Christian Reader her are sett forthe for thine instruction / and comforte / certen learned / and comfortable con∣ferences / Betwene the two Reueren∣de / and godly fathers M. Rydley / and M. Laty∣mer: whose bodies the Romishe tyrannie of late ha¦the tormented / and fier hathe consumed: whose sowles mercie hathe embraced / and heauen hathe receiued / yelding thone vnto the enemie to deathe / for testimonie of the truthe / commending thother vnto god in suer hope of lyfe. Wher vnto is also ad¦ded a learned treatise / and a cleare confutation of the fonde / and wicked opinion of Transubstantia∣tion written by the said M. Ridley.

smalle treasures. That as in life thei profited the by teaching / and in deathe by example / so after death they may doe the goode by writing. And albeit the matter of it selfe is sufficiente to commend it selfe / yet it cannot be but the worthines of the writers / will encrease creditte / and giue no small authoritie to the writynges. M. Latymer came earlier in the morning / and was the more auncient wor∣keman in the lordes vineyarde /  who also may ve∣rie well be called (as diuerse learned men haue ter∣med hym) the Apostle of Englād: as one much mo¦re worthie of that name / for his true doctrine / for his sharpe reprouinge of sinne / and superstition / then was Augustine bisshop of Canturburie for bringing in the popes monkerie / and false rel
