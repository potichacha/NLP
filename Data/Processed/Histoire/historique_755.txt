CHAPTER I


EARLY DAYS AT KIRKCALDY 1723-1737 Return to Table of Contents Adam Smith was born at Kirkcaldy , in the county of Fife , Scotland , on the 5th of June 1723 .
He was the son of Adam Smith , Writer to the Signet , Judge Advocate for Scotland and Comptroller of the Customs in the Kirkcaldy district , by Margaret , daughter of John Douglas of Strathendry , a considerable landed proprietor in the same county .
Of his father little is known .
He was a native of Aberdeen , and his people must have been in a position to make interest in influential quarters , for we find him immediately after his admission to the Society of Writers to the Signet in 1707 , appointed to the newly-established office of Judge Advocate for Scotland , and in the following year to the post of Private Secretary to the Scotch Minister , the Earl of Loudon .
When he lost this post in consequence of Lord Loudon 's retirement from office in 1713 , he was provided for with the Comptrollership of Customs at Kirkcaldy , which he continued to hold , along with the Judge Advocateship , till his premature death in 1723 .
The Earl of Loudon having been a zealous Whig and Presbyterian , it is perhaps legitimate to infer that his secretary must have been the same , and from the public appointments he held we may further gather that he was a man of parts .
The office of Judge Advocate for Scotland , [ Pg 2 ] which was founded at the Union , and which he was the first to fill , was a position of considerable responsibility , and was occupied after him by men , some of them of great distinction .
Alexander Fraser Tytler , the historian , for example , was Judge Advocate till he went to the bench as Lord Woodhouselee .
The Judge Advocate was clerk and legal adviser to the Courts Martial , but as military trials were not frequent in Scotland , the duties of this office took up but a minor share of the elder Smith 's time .
His chief business , at least for the last ten years of his life , was his work in the Custom-house , for though he was bred a Writer to the Signet - that is , a solicitor privileged to practise before the Supreme Court - he never seems to have actually practised that profession .
A local collectorship or controllership of the Customs was in itself a more important administrative office at that period , when duties were levied on twelve hundred articles , than it is now , when duties are levied on twelve only , and it was much sought after for the younger , or even the elder , sons of the gentry .
The very place held by Smith 's father at Kirkcaldy was held for many years after his day by a Scotch baronet , Sir Michael Balfour .
The salary was not high .
