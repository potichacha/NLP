William Penn's last Farewel to England: Being, an Epistle containing a Salutation to all Faithful Friends, a Reproof to the Ʋnfaithful; and a Vi∣sitation to the Enquiring, in a Solemn Farewel to them all in the Land of my Nativity.


A Salutation to the Faithful
YE are beloved of me above all the Sons and Daugh∣ters of Men, who have received and bowed to the blessed Appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ in your Hearts, and that have not counted any thing dear for the Testimony of his Cross and Gospel, but have unfeign∣edly loved and obey'd his Light within, and not been afraid to confess it without: You that have not been of∣fended in him, though the World hath not received him, but bitterly mocked and persecuted his saying Appear∣ance; To you doth my Soul reach, in the Love that ma∣ny Waters cannot quench, nor Time, nor Distance wear away, beseeching the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be with you, and bless you with his abundant Goodness and Mercy, Oh, Friends! go on, you are cal∣led to an high and heavenly calling, the Trumpet hath given you a certain Sound; follow your Captain, be Va∣liant, fight the good Fight of Faith, lay hold on Eternal Life, that you may finish your Course with Joy; a Crown is at the end, a Diadem that will never fade away, the Reward of the Righteous at the end of all his Troubles.

Oh! ye that received the Truth for the▪ Truth's sake, who have loved it above all, and for it left all, that being tried, fainted not, but en∣dured; and who to this Day have not sought your selves, but the Lord, and have counted nothing dear, that you might lift up his Name amongst men, who being revived, have blessed; and being persecuted, have suffered; and be∣ing defamed, have yet entreated; and are to this day temp∣ted, buffetted, and accounted by too many as the Off-scouring of the Land; be not discomforted, but Gird up the Loins of your Minds, be sober, watch, pray and hope to the End; for through many Tribulations are we to enter the Rest and City of
