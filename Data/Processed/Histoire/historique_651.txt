His Majesties gracious declaration to all his loving subjects for liberty of conscience: 


 [illustration]  His Majesties GRACIOUS DECLARATION To all His Loving Subjects for Liberty of Conscience.JAMES R.IT having pleased Almighty God not on∣ly to bring Us to the Imperial Crown of these Kingdoms through the greatest difficulties, but to preserve Us by a more than ordinary Providence upon the Throne of Our Royal Ancestors, there is nothing now that We so ear∣nestly desire, as to Establish Our Go∣vernment on such a Foundation, as may make Our Subjects happy, and unite them to Us by Inclination as well as Duty; Which We think can be done by no Means so effectually, as by granting to them the free Exer∣cise of their Religion for the time to come, and add that to the perfect Enjoyment of their Property, which has never been in any case Invaded by Us since Our coming to the Crown: Which being the two things Men value most, shall ever be preserved in these Kingdoms, during Our

Reign over them, as the truest Methods of their Peace and Our Glory. We cannot but heartily wish, as it will easily be believed, that all the people of Our Dominions were Members of the Catholick Church, yet We humbly thank Almighty God, it is, and hath of long time been Our constant Sense and Opinion (which upon diverse Occasions We have Declared) that Conscience ought not to be constrained, nor People for∣ced in matters of meer Religion: It has ever been directly contrary to Our Inclination, as We think it is to the Interest of Government, which it destroys by spoiling Trade, depopulating Countreys, and discouraging Strangers; And finally, that it never obtained the End for which it was employed: And in this We are the more Confirmed by the Reflections We have made upon the Conduct of the four last Reigns. For after all the frequent and pressing Endeavours that were used in each of them, to re∣duce this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, it is visible the Suc∣cess has not answered the Design, and that the Difficulty is invincible; We therefore out of Our Princely Care and Affection unto all Our Loving Sub∣jects, that they may live at Ease and Quiet, and for the increase of Trade, and incouragement of Strangers, have thought fit by ver∣tue of Our Royal Prerogative, to issue forth this Our Declaration of Indulgence; making no doubt of the Concurrence of Our Tvvo Houses of Parliament, vvhen We shall think it convenient for them to Meet.
In the first place We do Declare, That We will Protect and Main∣tain Our Arch-bishops, Bishops, and Clergy, and all other Our Sub∣jects of the Church of England, in the free Exercise of their Religion, as by Law Established, and in the quiet and full Enjoyment of all their Possessions, without any Molestation or Disturbance whatso∣ever.
We do likewise Declare, That it is Our Royal Will and Pleasure, That from henceforth the Execution of all and all manner of Penal Laws in Matters Ecclesiastical, for not coming to Church, or not Re∣ceiving
