aswell in Churches, as in other publike places within this Realm,
only to shewe a memory to the posteritie of the persons there bury∣ed,
or that had ben benefactours to the buyldynges, or dotations of
the same Churches or publique places, and not to noryshe any kynd
of superstition: By which meanes, not only the Churches and pla∣ces
remayne at this present day spoyled, broken, and ruinated, to thoffence of all noble and gentle
heartes, and thextinguyshyng of the honorable and good memorye of sundry vertuous and noble
persons deceassed: But also the true vnderstandyng of diuers families in this Realme (who haue
descended of the bloud of the same persons deceassed) is thereby so darkened, as the true course of
theyr inheritaunce may be hereafter interrupted, contrary to Iustice, besydes many other offences
that hereof do ensue, to the sclaunder of such as eyther gaue or had charge in tymes paste onely to
deface monumentes of Idolatry, and false fayned Images in Churches and Abbeyes. And there∣fore,
although it be very harde to recouer thynges broken and spoyled: yet both to prouide that no
such barbarous disorder be hereafter vsed, and to repayre asmuche of the sayde monumentes as
conueniently may be: Her Maiestie chargeth and commaundeth all maner of persons, hereafter

Image of Kynges, Princes, or noble estates of this Realme, or of any other that haue ben in times
past erected and set vp, for the only memory of them to their posteritie in common Churches, and
not for any religious honour: or to breake downe or deface any Image in glasse wyndowes in any
Church, without consent of the Ordinary: vpon payne, that whosoeuer shall herein be founde to
offend, to be committed to the next Gayle, & there to remayne without bayle or mainprise, vnto the
next cōmyng of the Iustices, for the delyuery of the sayd Gayle, and then to be further punyshed by
fine or imprisonment (besydes the restitution or reedification of the thyng broken) as to the sayde
Iustices shall seme meete, vsyng therin thaduise of Thordinarye, and yf nede shalbe, thaduise also
