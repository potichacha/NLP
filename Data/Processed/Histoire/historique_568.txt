 [illustration] DIEV ET MON DROITHONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE [royal blazon surmounted by a crown and flanked by the English lion on one side and the Scottish unicorn on the other] ❧ By the King.❧ A Proclamation concerning Tynne.WHereas for the well ordering of the Tynne of this Our Realme of England, diuers and sundry good Customes, Lawes, and Ordi∣nances haue beene heeretofore vsed, made, and established, by the wisedome of former times, amongst which there hath beene euer speciall care and prouision, that all the said Tynne should be duely brought to certaine places of Coynage, and there tryed and assayed and peyzed at certaine Ballances, and by weight vsed for that pur∣pose, and by a Stampe or Marke ordained for that purpose, sealed and allowed before the same bee put to sale within the Land, or offered to bee Shipped for Forreigne vent. And to that end also Our noble Progenitors haue beene at charge to erect and maintaine certaine Coynage houses in seuerall Townes within Our Counties of Deuon and Cornwall, lying most commodious for the said Coynage, with Ballances and Weights there, and Officers and Ministers attending that seruice. At which places at certaine dayes of Coynage and post-Coynage appointed, speciall Officers of the Stannaries doe, and haue beene wont duely to attend, to receiue, try, assay, peyze, coyne, seale and allow the said Tynne, by setting a Marke, Seale, or Stampe vpon the same.
By which meanes both Wee and Our Progenitors were secured of the emption or pre∣emption and Coynage duties of the said Tynne, being ancient and vndoubted hereditarie

And whereas out of a Princely care to cherish and maintaine the Trade and Working of such a worthie and Staple Commoditie, of so much honour and profit to this Common∣wealth, Our deare Father (of blessed memorie) did not long since take order to allow a greater price for the working and making thereof then euer was giuen before, which We haue hither-vnto continued.
And Our said late Father in His life time by sad aduice, did settle the Tynne businesse in a more orderly and better course then euer before it was, aswell for the benefit of Vs, being then Prince, as for the contentment and satisfaction of Our louing Subiects, the Merchants and Pewterers of London and other places.
Yet neuerthelesse We are informed, That by the secret practice and combination of sundry ill minded and couetous owners and workemen of the said Tynne and Tynne works, a great part of the said Tynne hath beene heeretofore, and daily is bought and sold, receiued, deliue∣red, and carried away vncoyned, aswell in Ships a
