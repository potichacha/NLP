The Loyal Conquest Or, Destruction of Treason, A SONGTo the Tune of, Lay by your Pleading, the Law ly's a Bleeding.
NOW Loyal Tories
May Tryumph in Glories,
The Fatal Plot is now betray'd,
The Rest were Shams and Stories.
Now against Treason,
We have Law and Reason;
And e'ry Bloody Whigg must go,
To Pot in Time and Season.
No Shamming, nor Flamming,
No Ramming, nor Damming,
No Ignoramus Jury's now,
For Whiggs, but only Hanging.

II.Look a little farther,
Place things in order,
Those that seek to Kill their King,
Godfrey might Murther.
Now they'r Detected,
By Heaven Neglected;
In black dispair cut their Throats,
Thus Pluto's Work's effected.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, &c.

III.Catch grows in Passion,
And fears this New Fashion;
Lest e'ry Traytor hang himself,
And spoyle his best Profession.
Tho' four in a Morning
Tyburn Adorning;
He Cryes out for a Score a time,
To get his Men their Learning:
No Shamming, nor Flamming, &c.

IV.Now we have sounded
The bottom which confounded,
Our Plotting Parliament of late
Who had our King surrounded.
Hamden and others,
And Trencher were Brothers;
Who were to kill the King and Duke,
And hang us for the Murthers.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, &c.

V.Surprising the Tower
And Court, in an Hour,
And enter at the Traytors Gate,
But was not in their Power.
O now Guards are Doubled,
E're long they will be Tripled,
The Harmony of Gun and Drum,
Makes Guilty Conscience Troubled.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, &c.

VI.If Grey is Retaken,
The Root o'th' Plot is shaken,
Russel and the rest Condemn'd,
The Bleeding Cause to waken.
Monmouth in Town still
With Armstrong his Council;
The Lady Gâ€”may find him out,
Under some Smock or Gown Still.
No Shamming, nor Flamming, &c.

VII.Give 'em no Quarter,
They Aim at Crown and Garter,
They're of that Bloody Regiment,
That made their King a Martyr.
Leave none to breed on,
They'd make us to bleed on;
They are the bloody'st Caniballs
That ever man did Read on.
No Shamming, nor Flamming,
No Ramming, nor Damming,
No Ignoramus Jury's now,
For Whiggs, but only Hanging.
