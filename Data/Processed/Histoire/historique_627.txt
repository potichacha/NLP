No. IX. TO THE ELECTORS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.Respectable Fellow Citizens,ANOTHER collateral circumstance worthy of serious reflection, is drawn from some ideas, which are understood to have been published in Boston, in certain essays under the signature of Pub∣licola, and which have been ascribed to Mr. John Adams, jun. They were written as a partial reply to "Paine's Rights of Man," in 1791; and have been since republished in London, with the follow∣ing title and motto, in 1793.

The principal and most dangerous abuses in the English government (says our author, distinguishing it from their consti∣tution, p. 18) arise, less from the defects inherent in the constitution, than from the state of society; the universal venality and corruption, which per∣vades all classes of men in that kingdom, and which a change of government could not reform. It is not admitted by the writer, that there are any de∣fects inherent in the constitution, though hereditary; nor is it at all objected to, though all the powers and virtues of the English constitution, with a chris∣tian hierarchy to aid them, have not been effic
