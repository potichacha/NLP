To his very loving friends, the high sherife, and iustices of peace of the county of Surrey.






TO HIS VERY LOVING FRIENDS, The High Sherife, and Iustices of Peace of the County of SURREY.
GENTLEMEN;IT is now some moneths since that the Protestation taken by the Lords, and House of Commons, was sent down into the Country, with an expectation that it should be gene∣rally taken throughout the Kingdome, for a testimony of their good concurrence with the Parliament, but through the remissenesse of some of those that had the care of recom∣mending it to others, very many there be that have not hitherto taken it. Now the House of Commons having discovered many dangerous designes plotted against the Parliament; and especially that of the fourth of this instant Ianuary, which had it taken effect would have strucken not onely at the Priviledges, but the very beeing of Parliaments, as will more appeare by the Declaration herewith sent unto you, which the House de∣sires you to publish throughout all parts of the Countie, Have thought fit once again to recommend the taking of this Protestation; And have therefore commanded me in their Name to desire you the High Sheriffe, and the Justices of the Peace of that County, to meet together in one place assoon as possibly you may, and there to take the Protestation your selves; and then dispersing your selves into your severall Divisions, that you will call toge∣ther the Minister, the Constables, Churchwardens, and Overseers of the poore of every Pa∣rish, and tender unto them the Protestation to be taken in your presence; And to desire of them, that they will very speedily call together the Inhabitants of their severall Parishes, both Housholders and others being of Eighteen yeares of age, or upwards, into one or more places, according to the largenesse of their Parishes, and to tender unto them the same Pro∣testation to be taken in their presence, and to take the names of those that doe take, and doe refuse to take the same Protestation, and to return them unto your selves at such time as you shall appoint, which the House desires may be so speedily, as that you likewise may return such Certificate, as you receive from them, to the Knights and Burgesses serving for that County, if the same County be within sixty miles of London, before the twentieth day of February next; And if the said County be above sixty miles distant from London, then before the twelfth of March next, wherein the House desires your greatest Care and Diligence, as a matter very much importing the good both of the King and Kingdome, which being all I have in command, I rest
Your very loving friend
WILLIAM LENTHALL, SPEAKER.
