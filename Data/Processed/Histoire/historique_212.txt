Mr. Barnard's ARTILLERY-ELECTION SERMON.
SERMON, PREACHED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ANTIENT AND HONOURABLE ARTILLERY COMPANY, IN BOSTON, JUNE 1, 1789; BEING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR ELECTION OF OFFICERS.

A SERMON, &c.ISAIAH, xi. 13.THE ENVY ALSO OF EPHRAIM SHALL DEPART, AND THE ADVERSARIES OF JUDAH SHALL BE CUT OFF: EPHRAIM SHALL NOT ENVY JUDAH, AND JUDAH SHALL NOT VEX EPHRAIM.—THE occasion of the present solemnity is evidently decent and pious. We cannot behold these military gentlemen, incorporated for pur|poses valuable to society, waiting upon God with humble supplication and thanksgiving on this day of their Annual Election, without sensations of approbation, esteem, and pleasure.—It is owing to the blessing of the great and beneficent Being whom they are assembled to worship, that, they have been sed, cloathed, and refreshed during the past year, and appear before him this day with the gaiety, elegance, and activity of the soldier.

Could we now summons them from their graves, they would be pleased with our at|tention, and with the warm feelings of parents and patriots would address us—"Shun our vices: Emulate our virtues. Let LEARNING, LIBERTY AND ARMS; INDUSTRY, GOOD MORALS, AND RE|LIGION be established and encouraged amongst you—and GOD, the omnipotent patron of all good societies, will be your defence and glory."
BUT, are there not those who will say—How af|frontive to worship the kind and beneficent Gover|nour of mankind cloathed with the garments of war, and the instruments of injury and death in

our hands! This appeal immediately interests the feelings, and commands the opinion of many, whom we cannot but love for their meek and gentle disposition, against war in every form, and under every condition.—However speciously de|fended, it is, say they, abhorrent to God, to the best feelings of human nature, and the amiable and charitable spirit of the religion of Jesus Christ.
PEACE is a lovely o
