THE
Prince of Orange
HIS
DECLARATION:
SHEWING THE
REASONS
Why he Invades ENGLAND. WITH
A Short PREFACE,
AND SOME
MODEST REMARKS on It.
LONDON:
Published by Randal Taylor, near Stationers-Hall,
MDCLXXXVIII.
The Prince of Orange's Decla∣ration,
shewing the Reasons,
why He invades England,
with a short Preface, and some
modest Remarks on it.THERE having been various▪ Discourses about the Reasonable∣ness
and Iustice of the Dutch Invasion, the Prince's great
Love and special Care of the Protestant Religion, and
English Protestants, set forth in the most Charming manner,
and the Desperateness of the Protestant State and Condition painted in the
blackest and most frightful Colours; Our Natural Leige Lord, notwith∣standing
his Unparallel'd Grace to all, represented as designing the greatest
Cruelty against his own Subjects:: strange Stories of ill things whispered,
and nothing less than a Secret L••gue between▪ His Majesty of Great Bri∣tain,
and the French King, to Extirpate all Protestants entred into:
These Reports are with so much Art and Cunning spread, as to startle
the most Considering Protestants of all Persuasions, whence nothing could
be more eagerly desired, than a Sight of the Prince of Orange's Declara∣tion;
For the Expectations of most Men are, That some Extraordinary
Secrets, some hidden Works of Darkness should be reveal'd, and brought
to Light; as generally those, who yet never saw the Prince's Declaration,
do still believe; But there not being one word of any such Treaty, we
cannot see why it is that the Prince comes Over; and if others impartially
Peruse the Declaration, we doubt not but 'twill Convince them, that they
give no Reason powerful enough to Iustifie so Bloody an Enterprise, as this,
in the Issue must needs be.
We will therefore give you a true Copy of the Prince's Declaration,
word for word, as it runs in the West.
THE
DECLARATION
OF HIS HIGHNES
William Henry,
By the Grace of GOD,
PRINCE of ORANGE, &c.Of the REASONS inducing Him,
To appear in Armes in the Kingdome of
England, for Preserving of the Protestant
Religion, and for Restoring the Lawes
and Liberties of England, Scotland and
Ireland.IT is both certain, and Evident to all men, that the Publike Peace and
Happines of any State or Kingdome, can not be preserved, where the
Lawes, Liberties, and Customs established, by the Lawfull authority in
it, are openly Transgressed and Annulled: More especially where the
alteration of Religion is endeavoured, and that a Religion which is contrary to
Law is endeavoured to be introduced: Upon which those who are most Im∣mediatly

Concerned in it, are Indispensably bound, to endeavour to Preserve
and maintain the established Lawes, Liberties and Customes: and above all
the Religion and Worship of God, that is Established among them: And to
take such an effectual care, that the Inhabitants of the said
