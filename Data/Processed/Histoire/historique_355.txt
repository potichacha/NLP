TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
SIR MARC-ALBERT
D'OGNATE KNIGHT,
Counsellour to his Catholick
Majesty, Commissary for Re∣nevving
of Magistrats in the
Province of Flanders, President
of the Chamber of Commerce
and Navigation, and Envoyé
from the King of Spain to his
Majesty of Great Brittain.SIR,It had been to be vvished that
vve might have concealed from
Strangers the Stains of our Na∣tion,
and that they might remain
ignorant that neither Fidelity to
our Prince, nor Charity to our
fellovv-Subjects can secure Ca∣tholicks

from the vvorst effects of
vvar in the midst of Peace:
such is the Virulence of one ma∣lignant
Party: vvho though
they enioy their lives by an un∣merited
Pardon of their Rebel∣lion,
vvill never pardon us for
our Loyalty.
In most Countreyes of Europe
there are agitated dayly Dispu∣tes
and Controversies about Re∣ligion,
and in Books on each side
ordinarily some sharpness is
mingled. But in England our
Lott must be 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, vve are
forced to contend vvith Adver∣saries
vvhose minds by our late
Tumults are rendred savage
and implacable. They to spite
us, resume a Nevv vvar

against Heaven it self, deriding
and blaspheming the Saints in
Glory. And against Gods
Church on earth they frame Ac∣cusations
never heard of before,
making her greatest Vertues passe
for the directly opposite greatest
Crimes. The most Saintly Exer∣cises
of Persons among us con∣secrated
to God and entirely
subiect to Authority are disgra∣cefully
stiled Fanaticism: Be∣cause
vve vvill not be chusers
each one of his ovvn Faith, vve
are accused to have an Enthusi∣astick
vvay of Religion: vvee
exercise Charity to our Freinds
Deceased, and that is called an
Impediment of Deuotion: vve
teach (as our Saviour did) that

the vvay to Heaven is strait,
and consequently that to enter
into it vve must practise Con∣fession
of Sins, Pennances, Mor∣tifications,
Praying, Fasting,
Alms-giving &c. and for this
vve are charged to be Hinderers
of Piety and a Good Life: Our
acknovvledging an Authority
in Gods Church to end Contro∣versies
is called an effectuall
Mean to multiply them: If out of
Compassion to persons guilty of
Schism, and out of a tender love
to Vnity any one among us
strains his vvitts to persvvade
our Adversaries that the dis∣tance
betvveen us is not so vast
as some of them seem vvilling to
conceive, his recompense must

be contemptuous revilings: No
Pagans or Cannibals must be
esteemed so blindly, so horribly
