TO THE KING's Most Excellent MAJESTY.SIR!IT would be a Defect both in Gratitude and Duty, if the first Discourse from the Pulpit in Favour of INOCULATION, was not most humbly inscribed to YOUR MAJESTY.
THE Nation, among numerous other Instances of paternal Regard, stands obli+ged to YOUR MAJESTY's Goodness and Resolution, for the Introduction and Pro|gress of that salutary Practice.
THE very early Concern YOUR MAJESTY shewed for the Safety and Happiness of this Kingdom, by exposing Your own va|luable Life, with great Intrepidity, to all the Hazards of War, was again apparent, when, with equal Firmness of Mind, You

exposed the important Lives of Your own tender and Royal Offspring, in the first Experiments made in Britain of the Effects of this Method of communicating an o|therwise dangerous and often fatal Disease.
AND probably to thisOperation we owe the Life of that illustrious PRINCE, to whom, under Divine Providence, this Nation, and the whole Protestant Interest, are so deeply indebted, for the happy Victory at the Battle of Colloden.
THAT YOUR MAJESTY's vigilant At|tention to the Welfare of Your People, in all Respects, may be rewarded with a very long and happy Reign upon Earth, and crowned with immortal Glory in Heaven, is the ardent Prayer of,
SIR!Your MAJESTY's Most obliged, and most devoted Subject and Servant,
ISAAC WORCESTER.ISAIAH LVIII. 7.—And that thou bring the Poor that are are cast out, to thy House.THESE Words are Part of a Description of that Humiliation and Worship, that is really acceptable to the great Creator and Go|vernor of the World; as highly proper in itself, and as a just Imitation of his divine Goodness, which regardeth the Prayer of the poor De|stitute, and despiseth not his Desire; and which, in the sacred Writings, is so frequently represented, both as an Example and an Encouragement to human Benevo|lence.
IS not this the Fast, says Almighty God, ver. 6. that I have chosen, to loose the Bands of Wickedness,— to undo the heavy Burdens; — is it not to deal thy Bread to the Hungry; and that thou bring the Poor that are cast out, (cast out and afflicted, as the original Word also signifies) to thy House? and
