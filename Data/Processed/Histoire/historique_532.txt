A
VINDICATION
OF THE
REASONABLENESS
OF Christianity, &c.MY Book had not been long
out, before it fell under the
Correction of the Author of
a Treatise, Entituled, Some Thoughts
concerning the several Causes and Occa∣sions
of Atheism, especially in the pre∣sent
Age. No contemptible Adversary
I'le assure you; since, as it seems, he
has got the Faculty to heigthen every
thing that displeases him into the Ca∣pital
Crime of Atheism; And breaths
against those who come in his way a

Pestilential Air, whereby every the
least Distemper is turned into the
Plague, and becomes Mortal. For who∣ever
does not just say after Mr. Ed's.
cannot 'tis evident escape being an A∣theist,
or a promoter of Atheism. I can∣not
but approve of any ones Zeal to
Guard and Secure that great and Funda∣mental
Article of all Religion and Mora∣lity,
That there is a God: But Atheism
being a Crime, which for its Madness as
well as Guilt, ought to shut a Man out
of all Sober and Civil Society, should
be very warily charged on any one by
deductions and Consequences which he
himself does not own, or at least do
not manifestly and unavoidably flow
from what he asserts. This Caution,
Charity, I think, obliges us to: And
our Author would possibly think him∣self
hardly dealt with, if, for neglect∣ing
some of those Rules he himself
gives, p. 31. & 34. against Atheism, he
should be pronounced a promoter of
it: As rational a Charge, I imagine, as
some of those he makes; And as fitly
put together, as the Treatise of the Rea∣sonableness
of Christianity, &c. brought in
among the causes of Atheism. However

I shall not much complain of him, since
he joyns me, p. 104. with no worse
Company than two Eminently Pious
and Learned Prelates of our Church,
whom he makes favourers of the same
Conceit, as he calls it. But what has
that Conceit to do with Atheism? Ve∣ry
much. That Conceit is of Kin to
Socinianism, and Socinianism to Athe∣ism.
Let us hear Mr. Ed's. himself. He
says, p. 113. I am all over Socinianized:
and therefore my Book fit to be placed
among the Causes of Atheism. For in
the 64. and following Pages, he en∣deavours
to shew, That a Socinian is an
Atheist, or lest that should seem harsh, one
that favours the Cause of Atheism, p. 75.
For so he has been pleased to mollifie,
now it is published as a Treatise, what
was much more harsh, and much more
confident in it, when it was Preached
as a Sermon. In this abatement he
seems a little to comply with his own
Advice against his fourth Cause of A∣theism;
which we have in these words,
pag. 34. Wherefore that we may effectu∣ally
prevent this folly in our selves, let
us banish Presumption, Confidence, and

Self-conceit; let us ex
