THE FOVR-LEGG'D ELDER
OR,
A horrible Relation of a Dog and an Elders Maid.To the Tune of The Lady's fall.
ALL Christians and Lay-Elders too
for shame amend your Lives,
I'le tell you of a Dog-trick now,
which much concernes your Wives:
An Elder's Maid neare Temple-Barre
(ah what a Queane was she)
Did take an ougly Mastive Cutte
where Christians use to be;
Help House of Commons, House of Peeres,
oh now or never help,
Th' Assembly hath not sate four yeares,
yet hath brought forth a Whelp.

One Evening late she stept aside,
pretending to fetch Eggs,
And there she made her selfe a Bride
to one that had foure leggs:
Her Master heard a rumblement,
and wonder'd she did tarry,
Not dreaming (without his consent)
his Dog would ever marry:
Oh house of Commens, house of Peeres, &c

He went to peep, but was affraid
and hastily did run
To fetch a Staffe to helpe his Maid,
not knowing what was done,
He tooke his Ruling Elders Cane,
and cry'd out helpe, helpe here,
For Swash our Mastive and poore Jane
are now sight Dog sight Beare.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres, &c

But when he came he was full sorry,
for he perceiv'd their strife,
That 'cording to the Directory
they two were Dog and Wife:
Oh (then said he) thou errant queane,
why hast thou me beguil'd,
I wonderd Swash was growne so leane,
poore Dog hee's almost spoyl'd.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres, &c.

I thought thou hadst no carnall sence
but what's in other Lasses,
And could have quench'd thy cupiscence
according to the Classes,
But all the Parish see it plaine
since thou art in this pickle,
Thou art an Independent queane,
and lov'st a Conve•ticle.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres, &c.

Alas now each Malignant Rogue
will all the World perswade
That she that's Spouse unto a Dog
may be an Elders Maid,
They'l jeere us if abroad we stirre,
good Master Elder stay,
Sir, of what Classis i• your Curre?
and then what can we say?
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres, &c.

They'l many gracelesse Ballads sing
of a Presbyterian,
That a Lay-Elder is a thing
made up halfe Dog halfe Man;
Out, out, said he, and smote her downe,
was mankind growne so scant▪
There's scarce another Dog in towne
had tooke the Covenant.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres, &c.

Then Swash began to looke full grim,
and Jane did thus reply,
Sir, you thought nought too good for him,
you fed your Dog too high,
Tis true, he tooke me in the lurch,
and leapt into my arme,
But as I hope to come to Church
I did your Dog no harme.
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres, &c.

Then she was brought to Ne•gate gaole
and there was naked stript,
They whipt her till the cord did faile,
as Doggs use to be whipt▪
Poore City Maids shed many a teare
when she was lash'd and lang'd,
And had she bin a Cavalir
surely she had been hang'd,
Oh house of Commons, house of Peeres,

Her's was but Fornication doomd,
for which she felt the lash,
But his w
