OBSERVATIONS
ON A
JOURNY
TO
NAPLES.
WHEREIN
The FRAUDS of Romish
Monks and Priests are farther
Discover'd.
By the Author of a late Book, Entituled,
The Frauds of Romish Monks
and Priests.
LONDON,
Printed by Samuel Roycroft, for Robert Clavell, at
the Peacock at the West-end of S. Pauls. 1691.
TO THE
Most Reverend Father in God,
JOHN,
Lord Archbishop of CANTERBURY;
Primate and Metropolitan of
ALL ENGLAND;
And
One of Their Majesties most Ho∣nourable
Privy Council.My Lord,IT has been none of the least Arti∣fices
of those of the Church of
Rome, to recommend their Re∣ligion
to the World, by denying
a great part of those Abuses which
the Protestants have charged upon it;

and ascribing that to the meer Inven∣tion
of their Adversaries, which at
the same time all, who have ever lived
in those Countries in which Popery
prevails, cannot but know, is every Day
practised among them.
I am sufficiently sensible how little
need there is for Me to say any thing
in Answer to this Pretence, which has
been so fully and solidly Confuted in
so many Learned Discourses as the
late Times produc'd upon this very
Argument: And which ought to make
them for ever ashamed of such Expo∣sitions
and Representations of their
Doctrin, as shew rather what the Au∣thors
of them would have their Reli∣gion
thought to be, than what indeed
it is. But yet having had some Oppor∣tunities
by my long Conversation
among them, to Observe more, and
penetrate farther into their Mysteries,
than Those who have been always
Strangers to their Communion can
well be supposed to have done; I
thought it might not be altogether Ʋse∣less
to Communicate my Reflections
to the World; and shew what Popery
is not in the smooth Descriptions of
Designing Men, but in the Open Pra∣ctice
and Profession of it, in those
Countries where they Act without Dis∣guise,
and look upon themselves to be
the truest and most Zealous Observers
of it.
This, My Lord, was my Design in
Publishing the following Discourses:
And it is this that emboldens me with
all Humility to present them to Your
Grace, who is so great a Judge, and so
proper a Patron of such an Under∣taking.
It is, My Lord, Your Honour to
Govern a Church, than which none has

ever approved it self more firm to the
Protestant Interest; or better deserved
to be esteem'd, what by all Ʋnderstand∣ing
Men it is allow'd to be, the strongest
Bulwark against Popery. But it is
much more, so to have been thought
worthy of such a Station, by Princes so
Wise and Discerning, and so affectio∣nately
concern'd for the Churches Good.
And it ought not to be wondred, if all
Men desire his Patronage, whose Ver∣tues
are no less Illustrious than His
Character.
But, My Lord, this was not all the
Reason I had, for desiring to prefix so
Great a Name to my Present Ʋnder∣taking.
I am well aware, that in the
foll
