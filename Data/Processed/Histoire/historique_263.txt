A testimony of truth with an exhortation of love unto such as are convinced by Gods light ... which is able to save their souls ... that so the adversary of their souls everlasting welfare may never prevail against any ... and they fall short of the race and of the purchased possession prepared for all them that in faithfulness perservere until the end / [by] Hen.

A Testimony of Truth, WITH AN EXHORTATION OF LOVE Unto such as are convinced by Gods Light, that they watch thereunto in all things, holding fast the word of faith, which is a∣ble to save their souls, and to give them victory over every assault of the wicked one, that to the Adversary of their souls everlasting welfare may never prevail against any, to turn them aside from the path of life, and they fall short of the race, and of the purchased possession prepared for all them that in faithfulness persever until the End.Hen.
