LUCRETIUS.A DISCOURSE.ECCLESIASTICUS X, 20.AMONG BRETHREN, HE THAT IS CHIEF, IS HONOURABLE.IT is the laudible purpose of our institution, by the most agreeable means, to expand our hearts for all the offices of humanity. It does not destroy, nor even weaken the love of private interest, of kindred, nations, or
opinions. It is intended to assist a generous energy of mind, in rising to the highest obli∣gations of charity. It accomplishes its end, by creating a society, in which we familiarize its special duties, by a voluntary association with all parts of the family into which we en∣ter.

Duties belong to each; but different duties to all. The wisdom of the head; the sincerity of the heart; the benevolence of the temper; the quickness of the senses; and the organic life, in each part, form the perfection of the

The choice of the man then, and not of the mas∣ter, is voluntary. The man may be changed, but the Master is perpetual. He is created by our necessity, and we owe him the full obedience of our Love.
