TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, CHRYSTOPHER CLEYTHEROWE Lord Major, and to THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVL, THOMAS SOAME, and IOHN GAYER, Sheriffes of this Renowned Citie LONDON. STEPHEN BRADWELL, wisheth continuance of all Earthly comforts, and assured Hope of Heavenly Happinesse.RIGHT HONOVRABLE, and RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL.SALOMON sayes,There is a Time to keepe Silence, and a Time to Speake. From this Rule take I this boldnesse, upon a just occasion to

Let your Noble favors then streng∣then this weak Hand which a Sons duty reaches forth to a Mothers support. Grate∣full Pitty commands me thus to do; and my knowledge both by Reading & Experi∣ence justifies the act.

To your Honour and your Worships a most obliged Servant. STEPHEN BRADWELL.TO ALL THAT HAVE Cause to love LONDON.FLie not from Her, because she is falling sicke; but rather joyne your hearts in Prayer, & your hands in Bounty to cheere her up. You love her, or at least have cause so to doe: for some of you have received Pleasures, some Profits, some Prefer∣ments. You have moreover a long time in her enjoy'd a secure Peace, that sweetned the other Benefits. Prague cannot boast it, nor many other Cities beyond the Seas: You walke in Scarlet, when others have waded in Bloud: You wore Weapons onely for Fashi∣on, when others were armed perforce: You have seene with Pleasure glorious Musters, when others have with horror felt the Swords furie. And now be∣
