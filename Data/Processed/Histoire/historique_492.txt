A short epistle to Friends to keep in the power of God in their peaceable habitations over the troubles of the world.


A SHORT EPISTLE to FRIENDS To keep in the Power of GOD in their Peaceable Habitations, Over the TROUBLES of the WORLD.ALL my dear Friends and Brethren, who are gathered by the Light, Grace, and Truth, and Power, and Spirit of Jesus Christ, to him the head over all, by whom were all things created, so the First∣born of every Creature, and the First begotten from the dead; follow him in his Resurrection, that you all may be partakers of it and Life ever∣lasting, and may sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, who is over all, the First and Last, and in him you have peace, who is not of this World, for in this World there is trouble; and the World did and doth hate Christ, yea and his Light, Grace, Truth, Power and Spirit; and therefore it is no marvel if the World do hate Christs Members that do follow him in his Light, Grace, Truth, Power and Spirit, and so with it receive him in them their Life and Salvation, and so he that hath the Son of God hath Life; who is the Fountain that filleth all that wait upon him, with his heavenly blessings and riches of Life from Christ the Rock and Foundation, that cannot be shaken, though the rocks and foundations of the World may be shaken, and cloven in pieces, and the Pillars of the Earth may reel and stagger, and all Hypocrites and Sinners may fear, but they that fear the Lord, and wait upon him, shall be as Mount Sion that cannot be removed, for the Lords Power is over all, by which he keeps his People to the day of Salvation.

And the golden Lamp in your Tabernacle all is to have to burn with the heavenly Oyl, which you have from Christ your high Priest, being returned to him, the great Shepherd and Bishop of your souls, who will bring you, his Sheep, into his safe Fold, who gives unto his Sheep eternal Life, and his Sheep shall not perish, neither shall any pluck them out of his hand.
