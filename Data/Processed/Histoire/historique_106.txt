TO THE RIGHT
HONORABLE,
AND MOST WOR∣THY
OF DOUBLE HONOR,
The Lady CAESAR, Wife
to the Right Honorable Sir
JVLIVS CAESAR Knt:
Late Mr. of the Rolles:
AND
One of His Majesties most Honora∣ble
Privy Counsell.WEE are all prisoners for a debt
we owe to Nature, commit∣ted
to the Gaole of this tran∣sitory
world: Some pay soo∣ner:
Some later: All must pay.
As yesterday, our Blessed Saviour paid
it: To day your deare Husband paid it: A
bitter example sweetly followed: He fol∣lowed

Him in his life: He followed Him
in his death: and so close in both, that as
in life, he was assuredly His by Grace, so
in death he is most certainly His in Glo∣ry.
Madam, my most entire affection
hath performed this last service to his
deare Remembrance, which I present to
your Noble hands, beseeching Almigh∣ty
God to comfort you, and hereafter to
raise you to the same pitch of Glory
where he is.
Madam,Your Lav faithfull servant,
FRA: QUARLES.TO MY HONO∣RABLE
FRIENDS,
Sir CHARLES CaeSAR Knight,
Sir IOHN CaeSAR Knight,
ROBERT CaeSAR Esquire.You Noble Brothers,GIve me leave to make you
Partners in my Dedica∣tion
with this honoura∣ble
Lady, as she is Part∣ner
in your Losse: How much I am
bound to this service, I appeale to
you: How much my expressions
come short of his merit, I appeale to
the world. His worth and my grief,
require stupifaction rather then lan∣guage:
Leves loquuntur; ingentes stu∣pent.
He hath left you the rich Inhe∣ritance
of a rare example, which if
you truely follow, shall follow you
to that glory which hee enjoyes,
whose gray hairs you have brought
in peace and honor to the ground.
The servant of his memory,
and your vertues,
FRA: QVA.An Elegie.LEt such invoke the Muses that have Art,
To broach their studied tears, & get by heart
Their ill-weigh'd sorrows; that can scrue their brains
To any tuneing; from Threnodian straines,
To love-sick Sonets; and from thence, can call
Their fancies to a light-foot Madrigall:
Let those invoke, whose mercenary' Affections
Are dry, and cannot give, without directions
From moist Melpomenè, but stick the Herse
With a faire texted lamentable verse,
More sorry then the Makers, trickt with flowers
Of bare Invention, which the twilight showers
Of Nature ne'r bedew'd; Let such as they
Invoke the Muses, whilst we cut our way

Through these our Alpine griefes, and sadly rise
With the sharp vinegre of suffused eyes:
Our high spring-tides are full, no need to borrow
A dropt' encrease the deluge of our sorrow.
O were the triviall
