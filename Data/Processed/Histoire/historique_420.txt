The Peake.
DUrst I expostulate with Providence,
I then should ask, wherein the innocence
Of my poor undesigning infancy,
Could Heaven offend to such a black degree,
As for th' offence to damn me to a place
Where Nature only suffers in disgrace.
A Country so deform'd, the Traveller
Would swear those parts Natures pudenda were:
Like Warts and Wens hills on the one side swell,
To all but Natives inaccessible;
 Th'other a blue scrofulous scum defiles,
Flowing from th' earths impostumated boyles;
That seems the steps (Mountains on Mountains
thrown)
By which the Giants storm'd the Thunderers
Throne,
This from that prospect seems the sulph'rous flood,
Where sinful Sodom and Gomorrah stood.

'Twixt these twin-Provinces of Britains shame,
The Silver Dove (how pleasant is that name)
Runs through a Vale high crested Cliffs o'reshade;
(By her fair Progress only pleasant made:)
But with so swift a Torrent in her course,
As shews the Nymph flies from her native source,
To seek what there's deny'd, the Suns warm Beams,
And to embrace Trents prouder swelling streams.
In this so craggy, ill-contriv'd a Nook.
Of this our little world, this pretty Brook

Alas! is all the recompence I share,
For all th' intemperancies of the Air,
Perpetual Winter, endless solitude,
Or the society of men so rude,
That it is ten times worse. Thy murmurs (Dove)
Or humour Lovers; or men fall in love
With thy bright beauties, and thy fair blue eyes
Wound like a Parthian, whilst the shooter flies.
Of all fair Thetis Daughters none so bright,
So pleasant none to taste, none to the sight,
None yields the gentle Angler such delight.
To which the bounty of her stream is such,
As only with a swift and transient touch,
T' enrich her steril borders as she glides,
And force sweet flowers from their marble sides.

North-East from this fair Rivers head there lies
ACountry that abounds with Rarities,

They call them Wonders there, and be they so;
But the whole Country sure's a wonder too,
And Mother of the rest, which seven are,
And one of them so singularly rare,
As does indeed amount to miracle,
And all the Kingdom boasts so far excel,
It ought not, I confess to be prophan'd
By my poor Muse; nor should an artless hand
Presume to take a Crayon up to trace,
But the faint Land-scape of so brave a place.
Yet, nobleChatsworth, for I speak of thee,
Pardon the love will prompt the injury
My Pen must do thee, when, before I end,
I fix dishonour, where I would commend.

The first of these I meet with in my way,
Is a vast Cave, which the old people say

One Poole an Out-
