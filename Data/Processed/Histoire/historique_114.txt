ALbeit I knowe not by what name wel to call you, sithens you haue loste the iuste name of Englishmen by disturbing the common peace of Eng∣lande, with cruell inuasion and spoile like e∣nimies: and the Quéenes Subiectes ye can not well be named, hauing throwne away your due submission and obedience: and yet her Subiectes still must you be, and cannot enioy the name of laufull enimies, being vnder her highnesse authoritie of correction, not to be raunsomed, nor by the curtesie of Marshall lawe to be dealte with as iust eni∣mies: but to be executed as Traitours and Rebels: Christians I can not term you that haue defaced the Communion of Christi∣ans, and in destroying the booke of Christes most holie Testament, renoūced your parts by his Testament bequethed vnto you: Yet I remember what you haue ben, by contrie Englishmen, by nature our kinsmen and al∣lies, by allegeaunce Subiects, by profession Christian men: I pitie what you now are, by crueltie and spoile of the land worse than enimies, by vnnaturall doings farther from duties of loue than extreamest strangers, by rebellion Traitors, by blaspheming Christ
