Kennebunk,July 4th, 1799.SIR,THE Committee for arranging the Festival of the day, in this place, are desired by those who joined in its celebration, to return you their thank for your very ingenious and patriotic ORATION, and to request a copy for the press.

Eternal praise and gratitude to the GOD of HEAVEN, who ordained, that we were born and do exist at a time when HE thus pours a profusion of His blessings on the land we live in.
