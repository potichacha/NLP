FREE-MASONRY.

NEW-YORK: PRINTED BY JACOB S. MOTT, FOR CHARLES SMITH, NO. 51, MAIDEN-LANE. —1797—
To the R. W. ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON, Esq CHANCELLOR, GRAND MASTER, AND R. W. JACOB MORTON, DEPUTY GRAND MASTER OF THE ANTIENT AND HONORABLE FRATERNITY OF FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS OF THE STATE of NEW-YORK, THIS WORK IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY CHARLES SMITH.
PREFACE.IN presenting the following work of COUSTOS'S Sufferings to the public, it may be remarked that few publications have received so extensive a patron∣age from the fraternity as the present, and none held in more estimation, as is fully evinced by the respectable list of subscribers annexed to the English copy, prefaced with a dedication to his Royal High∣ness the duke of Cumberland, the then Grand Mas∣ter. This proving the character and merit of the narrative, has induced the publisher to presume it will be equally acceptable to the craft on this side the Atlantic, particularly as masonry flourishes in this country in a manner hitherto unequalled in the history of cur noble order. A work of this na∣ture well authenticated must be considered as a va∣luable tract—which for the honour of humanity it is firmly hoped, the like scenes will again be never repeated.
An original attempt to arrange in order the different domestic lodges, will appear obviously dif∣ficult to effect with accuracy; but so far as the sub∣ject
has admitted, no attention has been withheld. Foreign lodges are enumerated from the latest ma∣sons calender that could be procured.
The songs, it is presumed, will prove an acceptable pocket companion to our meetings, and if they have a tendency in promoting recrea∣ting pleasure, the wishes of the editor will be am∣ply gratified.
INTRODUCTION.I CAN justly affirm, that it was not vanity that induced me to publish the following accurate and faithful relation of my sufferings in the Inquisition of Lisbon. A strong desire to justify myself with regard to the false accusations brought by that tri∣bunal against me; as well as against the brother∣hood of Free-Masons, of which I have
