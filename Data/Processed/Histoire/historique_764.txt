A DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION LATELY AGITATED IN THE Congress of the United States, WITH REGARD TO THE OBLIGATION OF TREATIES, CONCLUDED BY THE President and Senate, AND THE UNQUALIFIED DUTY OF THE House of Representatives TO CARRY THEM INTO EXECUTION, SO FAR AS ANY ACT OF THEIRS, MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THAT PURPOSE;
BEING AN EXTRACT FROM A PUBLICATION IN THE WESTERN TELEGRAPHE, SAID TO BE WRITTEN BY ALEXANDER ADDISON, PRESIDENT OF THE COURTS OF THE FIFTH DISTRICT.
PITTSBURGH: PRINTED BY JOHN SCULL.
INTRODUCTION BY THE PUBLISHER.IT has been acknowledged that by our Address to the House of Representatives, the Western Coun∣try has had the credit of coming forward first to sup∣port the Constitution, on the controverted question. But, if I am not mistaken in my judgment; it deserves the credit, also, of having produced the best reasoning on the question, that has appeared, in, or, out of Con∣gress. I have seen all that has appeared in the Ga∣zettes, as having been said on this subject in the House, but have found nothing equally satisfactory with this short discussion. I have made an extract from it, for the sake of thinking men, who may wish to be satisfied, as I have been, and may not have seen the Telegraphe. Let what will be thought of it at present, I will stake any reputation which it may be my ambition to possess as a literary man (and this, with that of moral ho∣nesty, is the only ambition I ever had) that ultimately it will be considered, as having the weight of a de∣cision, and equal to an authority in law; not from the place from whence it was given, but from its own intrinsic force of Argument.
Let it not be understood from this eulogy, that I at all involve myself in any opinion with regard to the original expediency of treating with Great-Britain; or the merits of the treaty concluded with that power; nor with regard to the question, where ought the treaty making power to be lodged. For the disser∣tation is wide of these subjects. I only declare myself to be one of those who have believed that the acceptance of the British treaty by the President and Senate gave it the validity of a constitutional contract, and that the national faith is pledged to fulfil it. Having expressed this opinion on public occasions in this country, it is na∣tural for me to be pleased with seeing that opinion so in∣controvertibly established; and it is not to support the reasoning that I give the voucher of my name; but to iustify my judgment that I publish the reasoning.
