TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, AND RIGHT WORTHY GENTLE∣man Sir William Sandis Knight, and to that wel∣disposed, & very Christian Ladie, the Ladie Mar∣garet Sandis his vertuous wife, and ioyfull consort, grace and glorie be mul∣tiplied in Christs kingdomes of grace and glorie.MVch honored. The Chri∣stian neighborhood, and kind commerce both of bountifull liberalitie, and gracious respect, which my selfe, and mine recei∣ued from you and yours this time twelue∣moneth by our contiguous vicinitie, hath occasioned me to be thus bold in saluting you after long silēce with a paper token, the

onely miniment, and memoriall of a Scho∣ler in this last, and worst age, that hath no∣thing for vs but bookes amongst the best, and by-words amongst the worst, as her one∣ly bequest, and our legacie. Howsoeuer, not∣withstanding it is the heartie ioy of Israel, & the vnspeakeable comfort of Iacob, that still some of the precious balme of Gilead that falls vpon Aarons head, doth distill downe euen vnto the skirts of his priestly clothing. And whereas others may haue spices, and balmes to preserue their bodies for a time, and monuments of brasse, and stone to con∣tinue a future glorie to their memorials: yet euer those haue bene most enobled, whose remembrances the tokens of vertue, and godlinesse haue endeuored to eternize, and keepe from the rottennesse of corrupted ba∣serie, and obscure obliuion.

yet I pray you entertaine them as the pre∣sence of my spirit, the pledge of mine heart, and the earnest of that affection, and loue which I iustly beare vnto you. And whereas before I spake in a great auditory in the pre∣sence and countenance of a liuing man, am now content in this my paines to bury my selfe in a dead letter of lesse effectuall per∣swasion: But principally I protest to this only end and purpose, that God might be magni∣fied (if it be his holy will) in me the weakest, & meanest of his seruāts both by the medi∣tations of mine heart, and in the endeauors of mine hand. The Treatise is of the loue of God deuoted vnto your selues in whom I haue obserued much loue toward God, to∣ward your brethren without, and amongst your selues at home. Goe on then (blessed in the Lord Iesu) in this sacred vettue that disposeth you to God so amiablie, and you shall find these
