A treatise of the nobilitie and excellencye of vvoman kynde, translated out of Latine into englysshe by Dauid Clapam


❧OF THE NOBI∣LITIE
AND EXCELLENCIE
OF VVOMANKYNDE.ALMYGHTY God
the maker & nou∣risher
of all thyn∣ges,
the Father
and goodnesse of
both male and fe∣male,
of hys great bountyfulnes,
hath create mankynde lyke vnto
hym selfe, he made them man and
woman. The diuersitie of which
two kyndes, standeth onely in the
sondry situation of the bodily par¦tes,
in whiche the vse of generati∣on
requireth a necessary differēce,
He hath giuen but one similitude
and lykenes of the sowle, to bothe
male and female, betwene whose
sowles there is noo maner dyffe∣rence

of kynd. The woman hathe
that same mynd that a man hath,
that same reason and speche, she
gothe to the same ende of blysful∣nes,
where shall be noo exception
of kynde. For after the euangeli∣call
truthe, they that ryse in theyr
owne proper kynde, shall not vse
the offyce of theyr kynde, but the
lykenes of angelles is promysed
vnto theym. And thus betwene
man and woman by substance of
the soule, one hath no higher pre∣emynence
of nobylytye aboue the
other, but both of them natural∣ly
haue equall libertie of dignitie
and worthynesse. But all other
thynges, the which be in man, be∣sydes
the dyuyne substance of the
sowle, in those thynges the excel∣lente
and noble womanheed in a
maner infynytely dothe excell the

rude grosse kynd of men, the whi∣che
thyng we shall playnly proue
to be true, not with counterfayte
and fayre flatteryng wordes, nor
also with the subtyll sophimes of
Logike, wherwith many sophi∣sters
were wont to blynde and de∣ceyue
men, but by the auctorytye
of moste excellent auctours, and
true writers of historys, and with
manifest reasons, yea with the te∣stimonies
of holye scrypture, and
by the ordynances and constitu∣tions
of lawes.
¶Fyrst to enter into this matter
the womā is made so muche more
excellent than man, in howe mo∣che
the name that she hathe recey∣ued,
is more excellente than hys.
For Adam soundeth Erthe, but
Eua is interpretate lyfe: and as
moche as the lyfe doth excel erth.

so moche the woman is to be pre∣ferred
aboue the man. Nor there
is no cause why this shulde be cal¦led
a feble argumēt, to gyue iuge¦ment
of thynges by the names.
For we knowe, that the hyghe ar∣tyficer
and maker of thinges and
names, fyrst dyd knowe the thyn∣ges,
before he named them, which
for as moch as he could not be de¦ceyued,
for thys purpose he made
the names, that it myght expresse
the nature, propertye, and vse of
the thynge. For the trouthe of
antyque names is suche, as the
veraye Romayne lawes testyfye,
that the selfe names are consonāt
to the thinges, and manifest signi¦fications
of them. Therfore an ar¦gument
of the names of thinges
amonges dyuynes and lawyars,
is of greate weyghte. As we rede

written of Nabal, after his name
is a fole, and folyshenes is with
him. Of this Paule in hys Epi∣stle
to the Hebrewes, purposynge
to shewe the excellency of Chryste
vseth this argume
