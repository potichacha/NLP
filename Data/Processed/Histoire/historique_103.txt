Charles R.TRusty and well beloved, We greet you well. We call to mind that in former times the constant custome was, by the mouth of the Lord Keeper for the time being, at the Court of Star-chamber, in the end of Tri∣nity Terme, to put the Judges of Assise (shortly after to undertake their severall Circuits) in minde of such things as were then thought necessary for the present, for the good government of the Kingdome. This course in Our judgement We doe well approve of, That although We want the opportunity, which We and Our Predecessors then had, of communicating Our thoughts to Our Judges, for the good of Our People, yet We doe still retaine the same care for the safety and prosperity of Our good Subjects. And much more, by how much the distempers and distractions of the pre∣sent times, unhappily fallen, have given us more occa∣sion. We have therefore thought it fit, to supply the de∣fect by these Our Letters; wherein, besides the generall care of Our justice, committed to Vs by God, and by Vs

Secondly, You shall let Our People of those Counties know, That, according to Our Kingly duty and Oath, We are also constantly resolved to maintain the Lawes of this Our Kingdome; and by, and according to them
to governe Our Subjects, and not by any Arbitrary power, whatsoever the Malevolent Spirits of any ill affected to Our Person or Government, have suggested, or shall sugges
