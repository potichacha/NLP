PROLOGUE,WRITTEN BY W. T. FITZGERALD, ESQ.
WHEN fam'd Columbus nobly dar'd to brave,
The untry'd perils of the Western wave;
Ten thousand dangers in his passage lay,
Dark was his night, and dreary was his day!
The rude companions of his bold design,
Fatigu'd with toil, against their chief combine:
When sudden—bursting on th' astonish'd view!
A world discover'd prov'd his judgment true.—
"Yet black ingratitude, the Great Man's fate!
"Pursu'd Columbus with envenom'd hate;
"But minds like his a base degen'rate race,
"Might meanly persecute—but not disgrace:
"The noble soul its energy maintains,
"In spite of dungeons, tyranny, and chains.

The sons of Europe found a guileless race,
No fraud was veil'd beneath the smiling face;
Their manners, mild, benevolent, and kind,
Pourtray'd the cloudless sunshine of the mind:
Bless'd in their Prince's patriarchal reign,
Whose pow'r reliev'd, but ne'er inflicted pain,
Their placid lives no fancy'd evils knew;
Their joys were many, and their wants were few.
One custom with their virtues ill agreed,
Which made Humanity with anguish bleed;
Compell'd at Superstition's shrine to bow,
The hapless victims of a cruel vow!
Their sweetest maids were often doom'd to prove,
No joy in friendship, and no bliss in love!
Yet love and nature cannot be supprest,
The sigh will heave, and palpitate the breast;
For spite of vows, which Heaven's wise laws disown,
Love sits triumphant on the heart—his throne!
And breaks those fetters bigots would impose,
To aggravate the sense of human woes!

The rigid laws of time, and place, our bard,
In this night's drama, ventures to discard:
If here he errs—he errs with him whose name,
Stands without rival on
