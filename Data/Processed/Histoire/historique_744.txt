Prologe.
IN colde Ianuary / whan fyre is comfortable
And that the feldes / be nere intollerable
Whan shepe & pastoures / leueth felde & folde
And drawe to cotes / for to eschewe ye colde
What tyme the verdure / of groūde & euery tre
By fyrst and stormes / is pryuate of beaute
And euery small byrde / thynketh the wynter longe
Which well apereth / by ceasynge of theyr songe
At this same season / two herdes / fresshe of age
At tyme apoynted / met bothe in one cotage
The fyrste hyght Faustus / the seconde Amyntas
Harde was to knowe / whiche better husbande was
For eche of them bothe / set more by pleasour
Than by habundaunce / of ryches or tresour
Imyntas was tormalle / and propre in his gere
A man on his cloke / shoulde not aspyed a here
Nor of his clothynge / one wryncle stode a wrye
In london he lerned / to go so manerly
Hygh on his bonet / stacke a fayre broche of tynne
His pursys lynynge / was symple poore and thynne
But a lordes stomake / and a beggers pouche
Full yll accordeth / suche was this comely slouche
In the towne and cyte / so longe getted had he
That frome thens he fledde / for det and pouerte
No wafrer / tauerne / halehous / or tauerner
•o hym was there hydde / whyle he was hosteler
•te was he hosteler / and than a wafrer
Than a coster monger / and last a tauerner
Aboute all London / there was no propre prym
But longe tyme had ben / famylyer with hym
But whan coyne•ayled no fanour more hadde he
•••erfore he roas gladde / out of the towne to fle

But shepeherde Faustus / was yet more fortunate
For alwaye was he / content with his estate
Yet nothynge he hadde / to conforte hym in age
Saue ā melche cowe / and a poore cotage
The towne he vsed / and grete pleasure hadde
To se the cyte / oftyme whyle he was ladde
For mylke and botter / he thyther brought to sell
But neuer thought he / in cyte for to dwell
For well he noted / the madde enormyte
Enuy / fraude / malyce / and suche inyquyte
Whiche reygne in cytes / therfore he ledde his lyfe
Vp londe in vyllage / without debate and stryfe
Whan these two herdes / were thus together met
Hauynge no charges / nor labour them to let
Thryr shepe were all sure / and closyd in a cote
Themselfe laye in lyttre / pleasauntly and hote
For costly was fyre / in hardest of the yere
Iohā men haue most nede / thā euery thȳge is dere
For passynge of tyme / and recreacyon
The bothe delyted / in cōmunycacyon
Famely they pledyd / of the dyuersyte
Ofrurall husbondes / and men of the cyte
Fa•tus accused / and blamed Cytezyns
To them imputynge / grete fautes cryme & synnes
Amyntas blamed / the rurall men agayne
And eche of thē bothe / his quareyl dyde maynteyne
All worthe dyspysed / all malyce and yll wyll
Clene layde a parte / eche dyde reherse his skyll
But fsyrste Amyntas / thus for to speke b
