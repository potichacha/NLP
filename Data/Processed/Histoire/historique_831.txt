A DIALOGUE between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER, concerning the HALF-WAY-COVENANT.Parishioner.SIR, this third visit I am come to make you, for I have lately read a piece, printed at New-London, entituled, "A dialogue between a minister and his parishioner, concerning the half-way-covenant con∣tinued;" said to be written by one of the most learned and ingenious ministers in the colony.

Minister.Be comforted, my friend, no blame is laid on you by the public.

grounded merely on the custom of the country: this led you to think, that the Lord's-supper was more holy than baptism. But while you hear all the ministers,
