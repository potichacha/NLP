TO
THE RIGHT
WORSHIPFVLL,
Mistris Elizabeth Backus,
Wife to Master Samuel Backus
Esquire, and Justice of Peace:
And to her three vertuous and
religious daughters, Mris. Mary
Standen, wife to Mr. Standen,
Esquire, and Iustice of the Peace;
Mris. Flower Backus, wife of Mr.
Iohn Backus, Esquire; and Mris.
Elizabeth Bellingham, wife to Mr.
Richard Bellingham, Esquire;
Grace and Peace from
the Fountaine.Right Worshipfull,PEarles are small in
quantitie, but great
in their quality, and
smaller often in the
weight than in their
worth▪ such an one is this which

I haue presented vnto you as a to∣ken
of my due respect and vnfai∣ned
loue to your selfe, and the
Church in your familie. Pearles
from earth fit not common per∣sons;
but this from heauen be∣longeth
to al who meane to partake
in the common saluation. As this
Pearle is yours in the common
right of Saints, so this offer of it
is yours by a second and more pe∣culiar
right, as who first helped
it out of the darke into this light.
Your earnest and often desires of
some of the written notes of this
Treatise, drew from me a promise
the thought of the paiment where∣of,
was my first thought of this
publication. And now this Pearle
being yours, weare it as your
chiefe ornament, the price of
which ra•seth your owne price and
recko•ing in the eyes of God and

good men, aboue the Carbun∣cles
and Rubies. Other orna∣ments
seuered from this, are but
beautifull vanities. The largest
reuenues, the richest estates, the
most ample treasures, the costliest
cabinets, filled with pearles and
precious stones, sets the person
wanting this pearle, in no higher
reckoning than common flints, or
other contemptible stones, with
him to whom the Nations are
but as the drop of a bucket,or as the dust of a ballance.
So of all naturall endowments,
we may compare them (as Salo∣mon
doth beantie) to a ring of
Gold, which outwardly commen∣deth
the wearer; But the iewell
of this ring is this pearle of the
Gospel
