❧ By the King.HAuing after some time spent in setling the politique affaires of this Realme, of late bestowed no small labour in composing cer∣taine differences Wee found among our Cleargie about Rites and Ceremo∣nies heretofore established in this Church of England, and reduced the same to such an Order and forme, as Wee doubt not but euery spirit that is ledde onely with Pietie, and not with Humor, shalbe therein satisfied: It appea∣red vnto Vs in the debating of those matters, that a greater contagion to our Religion, then could proceed from those light differences, was imminent by persons common Enemies to them both, Namely the great number of Priests both Seminaries and Iesuits aboun∣ding in this Realme, aswell of such as were here before our comming to this Crowne, as of such as haue resorted hither since, vsing their functions and professions with greater libertie, then heretofore they durst haue done, partly vpon a vaine confidence of some Innouation in matters of Religion to be done by Vs, which Wee neuer intended, nor gaue any man cause to expect, & partly vpon the assurance of our generall Pardon, granted according to the custome of our Progenitors at our Coronation, for of∣fences past in the dayes of the late Queene, which Pardons many of the said Priests haue procured vn∣der Our great Seale, and holding themselues thereby free from the danger of the Lawes, doe with great audacitie exercise all Offices of their profession, both saying Masses, perswading our Subiects from the Religion established, and reconciling them to the Church of Rome, and by consequence sedu∣cing them from the true perswasion, which all Subiects ought to haue of their duetie and obedience to Vs. Wherefore, forasmuch as by way of prouidence to preserue their people from being corrupted in Religion, pietie and obedience, is not the least part of Royall duetie, Wee hold our selfe obliged both in conscience and in wisdome, to vse all good meanes to keepe our Subiects from being infected with su∣perstitious opinions in matter of Religion, which are not onely pernitious to their owne soules, but the ready way and meanes to corrupt their duetie and allegiance, which cannot be any way so surely performed, as by keeping from them the ministers and instruments of that Infection, which are the Priests of all sorts ordained in forraine parts, by authoritie prohibited by the Lawes of this land, Con∣cerning whom therefore We haue thought it fit to publish to all our Subiects this open declaration of our pleasure. That where there be of Priests at this present within our kingdome, be they Regular or without Rule, diuers sorts, some in prison, some at libertie, and of both, some hauing obtained our Par∣don vnder our great Sea
