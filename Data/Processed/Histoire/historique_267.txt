THE MILLENNIUM.THOUGH there has been no age of the Church in which the Millenium was not admitt∣ed by individual divines of the first eminence, it is yet evident, from the writings of Eusebius, Irenaeus, Origen, and others among the ancients, as well as from the histories of Dupin, Mosheim, and all the moderns, that it was never adopted by the whole church, or made an article of the established creed in any nation.
About the middle of the fourth century the Millinarians held the following tenets:
1st. That the city of Jerusalem should be re∣built, and that the land of Judea should be the habitation of those who are to reign on earth one thousand years.
2d. That the first resurrection was not to be confined to the martyrs, but that after the fall of Antichrist all the just were to rise, and all that were on the earth were to continue for that space of time.
3d. That Christ shall then come down from Heaven, and be seen on earth, and reign there with his servants.
4th. That the saints, during this period, shall enjoy all the delights of a terrestial paradise.
These opinions were founded upon several passages of Scripture, which the Millenarians, among the fathers, understood in no other than a literal sense; but which the moderns, who hold that opinion, consider as partly literal and partly metaphorical. Of these passages, that upon which the greatest stress has been laid is the following: "And I saw an angel come down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old servant, which is the devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more till the thou∣sand years shall be fulfilled, and after that he must be loosed a little season. And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was giv∣en unto them, and I saw the souls of them
