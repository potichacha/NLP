A true Copy of Record, Examined by SAMUEL WYLLYS, Sec'ry.An Election Sermon.1 CHRONICLES xxix. 11.— Thine is the KINGDOM, O LORD, and thou art ex|alted as HEAD above ALL.
IN the passage which has now been read, we have the devout acknowledgment of king David, who was the first magistrate, in the most respectable kingdom, which, at that time, existed. He was as remarkable for piety and religion, as for emi|nence and distinction, in the Jewish nation.
IT was not an inconsiderable evidence, of the fer|vor of his piety, that he maintained the most ex|alted and reverential conceptions of God, in the height of earthly magnificence, amid the splen|dor and pomp of a Court, which so commonly

dazzle the eyes of mankind, and plunge them in|to scenes of voluptuousness.
NEBUCHADNEZZAR, who was at the head of the Chaldean Empire, was so intoxicated, with the splendors of royalty, that "his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride," so that he did not know and consider, "That the MOST HIGH ruleth in the kingdom of men." And, fact and experience afford the most convincing evidence, that worldly distinctions and honors, through the native corrup|tion of the human heart, have a most powerful tendency to render men unmindful of Him, by whom "kings reign and princes decree justice." But, this was very far from being exemplified in David. Although, from a shepherd, he was raised to a throne, and exalted as the head of a respecta|ble and truly great nation, which always reveren|ced his authority; yet, he did not, through pride of heart, so rate his dignity and worldly conse|quence, as to think it beneath him, devoutly to ac|knowledge God, as the Supreme Ruler of the uni|verse. He was sensible, that his elevated station and worldly magnificence, were the fruit and ef|fect, of God's sovereign disposal. In the text, he most devoutly ascribes every thing to Him. "Thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above ALL." And, in the succeeding words, "Both riches and honors come of thee—in thine
hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all."
IT may be further observed, that king David was not only ready, most solemnly to acknowledge, the existence of
