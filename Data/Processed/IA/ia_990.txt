{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Task: Design a data warehouse solution to support rapid lookup of some key metrics. (Many more details below) What you will submit for this task: A description and/or diagram of any tables you would make, showing what columns or fields would be included, how the tables relate to each other (or don’t), and how they relate to the source data. (Communicating table names and what they hold is sufficient, you don’t need to exhaustively list every field.)  Note: we are not expecting a polished and professional diagram. A working sketch that communicates your ideas is sufficient. Feel free to draw on paper and snap a picture if that’s fastest for you!). Write the SQL for creating at least one of the tables in your design from the source tables. Write an SQL query that could be run against your design to answer one of the business questions provided. Note: SQL is meant to be a pseudocode “pencil and paper” exercise. We are not evaluating your knowledge of correct syntax or nuanced functionality of any particular flavor of SQL, but rather your ability to communicate your design with precision as demonstrated by the code you would write. We are looking for semantic precision not syntactic.  A brief written justification for your design choices, including assumptions you made, and any other considerations you think are important. (Some of this information may naturally be included in your response to #1, if so that’s fine, don’t repeat it here). How to submit: Put your responses to all 4 tasks into a single document or slide deck (google doc or google slides preferred, but docx or pptx is fine too). Remove your name from anywhere in task materials. (We review these tasks de-identified to avoid bias in judging the work product) Task Details Background: Data analysts on the team, and novice SQLers in the org, need quick ways to look up the business metrics and answer the business questions described below. As the analytics engineer, your task is to propose a design for analytics tables to support these metrics building from a set of source tables that are loaded from our production database. (more details and information about the production tables are provided below.) Here are the business metrics we need to support.
