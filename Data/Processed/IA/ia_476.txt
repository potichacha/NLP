Give me few specific ideas to improve fuel sales at terminals to Marketers?

Loyalty programs: Implementing a loyalty program that rewards marketers for purchasing fuel from your terminal can be an effective way to incentivize repeat business. The program can offer discounts, free merchandise, or other perks that make purchasing from your terminal more appealing. Flexible payment terms: Offer flexible payment terms that are tailored to the needs of your customers. For example, some marketers may prefer to pay cash upfront, while others may need longer payment terms to manage their cash flow. By offering a range of payment options, you can make it easier for marketers to do business with you. Streamlined ordering process: Implement a streamlined ordering process that makes it easy for marketers to place their orders. This can include online ordering systems, mobile apps, or other technologies that simplify the process and reduce the time it takes to place an order. Competitive pricing: Offer competitive pricing that is in line with market rates. If your prices are too high, marketers may choose to purchase fuel from other terminals. Regularly reviewing your pricing strategy can help ensure that you remain competitive and attractive to potential customers. Marketing and promotion: Consider investing in marketing and promotion efforts to attract new customers to your terminal. This can include advertising campaigns, email marketing, social media promotion, or other tactics that help increase awareness of your terminal and its offerings. Quality control: Make sure that the quality of your fuel is consistently high. Marketers want to ensure that they are purchasing high-quality fuel that will not harm their equipment or vehicles. Conducting regular quality control checks and sharing the results with your customers can help build trust and loyalty over time. Customer service: Provide excellent customer service at every touchpoint. This includes responding promptly to inquiries, providing accurate information about your products and services, and addressing any issues or concerns that arise. By providing a positive customer experience, you can build strong relationships with your customers that will keep them coming back for more.
