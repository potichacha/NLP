how to .filter method to remove duplicate value of an array in javascript?

In JavaScript, you can use the  .filter()  method to remove duplicate values from an array. Here's an example of how to do it: In this example, the  .filter()  method takes a callback function that is called on each element of the original array. The callback function takes three arguments: the current value, the current index, and the array itself. The callback function uses the  .indexOf()  method to check if the current value is the first occurrence of that value in the array. If it is, the  .indexOf()  method will return the current index, which will match the current index passed as an argument to the callback function. If it is not, the  .indexOf()  method will return a different index, which means that the current value is a duplicate. By returning the comparison of the two indexes as a Boolean value, the  .filter()  method will create a new array with only the unique values.
