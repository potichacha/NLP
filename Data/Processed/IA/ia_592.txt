Write a song for my niece, Morgan, on her 3rd birthday

Verse 1: Happy birthday, Morgan, it's your special day You're turning three and growing in every way With your smile so bright and your eyes so blue We're so happy to be here celebrating with you Chorus: You're a shining star, our sweet little girl You light up our world with your precious curls We love you more than words can say Happy third birthday, Morgan, have a wonderful day Verse 2: You're growing up so fast, it's hard to believe From crawling to walking, you've achieved You're learning new things every single day And we're so proud of you in every single way Chorus: You're a shining star, our sweet little girl You light up our world with your precious curls We love you more than words can say Happy third birthday, Morgan, have a wonderful day Bridge: We hope your day is filled with joy and fun Playing with your toys and in the sun Eating cake and blowing out candles too All these things we wish for you Chorus: You're a shining star, our sweet little girl You light up our world with your precious curls We love you more than words can say Happy third birthday, Morgan, have a wonderful day Outro: Morgan, we love you so much And we know that you're going to touch So many lives with your kind heart We can't wait to see all the great things you'll start.
