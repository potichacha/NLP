Sure! Here's a Swift function that prints all possible paths from the top left to the bottom right of an NxN matrix: The  printAllPaths  function initializes an empty path array of length 2*n and then calls the  printPathsHelper  function to print all possible paths. The  printPathsHelper  function takes the matrix size  n , the current row and column  row  and  col , the path array  path , and the current index  idx  as input. It uses recursion to generate all possible paths by either moving right or moving down, and adding the corresponding instruction to the path array. The  idx  parameter is used to keep track of the current index in the path array. When the function reaches the bottom-right corner of the matrix, it prints the current path using  print(String(path)) .
