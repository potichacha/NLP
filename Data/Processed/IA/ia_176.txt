What's the difference between HR Digitalization and HR Digital Transformation

HR digitalization typically involves the automation and digitization of existing HR processes, such as the use of digital tools to streamline recruitment or payroll processes. HR digital transformation, on the other hand, involves a more fundamental change in the way HR operates, often requiring a shift in mindset and culture. This may include reimagining HR processes and services through the use of new technologies, data analytics, and more agile ways of working. It's a more comprehensive and strategic approach to leveraging digital technology to improve HR performance and drive business outcomes.

how much will HR digitalization replace human, and how should human value add

HR digitalization is designed to automate routine and repetitive HR tasks, freeing up HR professionals to focus on more strategic activities that require human expertise and creativity. While some HR tasks, such as data entry and administrative tasks, may be replaced by technology, HR digitalization is not meant to replace human workers altogether. Instead, HR professionals can focus on value-adding activities such as developing and implementing talent management strategies, fostering employee engagement and well-being, providing career development support, and managing complex employee relations issues. They can also use data and analytics to provide insights and drive evidence-based decision-making. Therefore, while HR digitalization may change the nature of some HR jobs, it is likely to create new roles and opportunities for HR professionals to add value in new ways.
