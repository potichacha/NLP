Create a simple Drawing App 1. Create an app using ReactJs, and Three.JS (with Drei library). 2. A user must be able to draw connected lines and some simple shapes, like rectangles, squares, triangles, curves 3. A 3D preview of the shape must be seen on the canvas (show 2d and 3d) 4. The 3D preview must auto-update when the 2D view changes 4. An area on the canvas should list the vertices (points) of the 2d shape/s.

To create a simple Drawing App using ReactJs, and Three.JS (with Drei library), you can follow the steps below: Here's some sample code to get you started: DrawingCanvas.js
