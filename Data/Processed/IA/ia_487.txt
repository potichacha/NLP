5 / 5i have a main page which have all movies, order by position ASC and openingdate DESC. now i click into a movie, i need the sql to get details of the movie and also previous and next movie\

Here's a modified version of your SQL query, written in a single line: This query first creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named  ordered_movies  to store the list of movies ordered by position and opening date, and assigns a row number based on this order. Then, it uses this CTE to join with the previous and next movies based on their row numbers.
