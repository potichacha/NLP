define compiler

A compiler is a computer program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed directly by a computer's CPU (central processing unit). The process of compilation involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization. Once the compilation process is complete, the resulting machine code can be executed by the computer without the need for the original source code. Compilers are essential tools for software development and enable programmers to create complex applications that run efficiently on a wide range of hardware platforms.
