"The Costs of Exclusivity: Public and Private Re-examined" by Gillian S. Morris and Sandra Fredman is an article that discusses the impact of exclusive systems on access to public services and benefits. The authors argue that exclusivity can create significant social, economic, and political costs, including perpetuating inequality and undermining social solidarity. They suggest that governments and policymakers should consider more inclusive approaches that prioritize the collective good and promote greater access to public goods and services.

what are the arguments?

In "The Costs of Exclusivity: Public and Private Re-examined," Morris and Fredman present several arguments to support their claims about the negative consequences of exclusivity. These arguments include: Exclusivity reinforces social inequality: When public goods and services are only available to certain groups, it reinforces existing social hierarchies and creates further disadvantages for those who are already marginalized. Exclusivity undermines social solidarity: When access to public goods and services is limited, it can erode the sense of shared responsibility and mutual support that underpins a strong society. Exclusivity is inefficient: When public goods and services are only available to a select few, it can result in duplication and waste of resources, as private alternatives are created to fill the gaps. Inclusive approaches are more effective: By prioritizing access to public goods and services for all members of society, it is possible to create more efficient, equitable, and sustainable systems that benefit everyone.

What is exclusivity?

Exclusivity refers to the practice of limiting access to certain goods, services, or opportunities to a particular group of people, while excluding others. This can be based on a range of characteristics, such as social status, income, race, gender, or other factors. Exclusivity can manifest in both public and private systems, such as education, healthcare, employment, housing, and social welfare. When exclusivity is pervasive in society, it can reinforce social hierarchies and perpetuate inequalities, creating significant social, economic, and political costs.
