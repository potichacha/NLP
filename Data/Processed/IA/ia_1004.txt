The advantages of a zero-knowledge proof-based voting system combined with blockchain technology are as follows: Protecting personal privacy: With zero-knowledge proofs, voters can prove that they are eligible to vote without revealing any personally identifiable information. This protects their privacy and prevents any attempt to link their vote to their identity. Non-disclosure of voting privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs also ensure that the voter's vote remains private and cannot be linked to their identity. This prevents any attempt to coerce or bribe voters into voting a certain way. End-to-end verifiability: By using blockchain technology, voters can verify that their vote was recorded correctly and counted in the final tally. This gives voters confidence that their vote was counted and helps to prevent any attempts to manipulate the vote. Ensuring integrity: The use of blockchain technology also ensures that all details of the voting process are implemented consistently and accurately, which helps to prevent any errors or fraud. Transparency: Finally, blockchain technology provides transparency, which helps to build trust in the voting process. Voters can see the entire process, from the casting of their vote to the final tally, which helps to ensure that the election was conducted fairly and impartially.
