Take MLK speech "I had a dream" but turn it into a top 100 rap song

(Verse 1) Yo, listen up, let me take you back in time, To the year 1963, it was quite a climb, A man with a dream, Martin Luther King, Fighting for equality, made the world sing. He stood on the steps, Lincoln Memorial, see, Gathered 'round, a crowd, a hundred thousand deep, He spoke to the masses, words that would last, A message of love, breakin' through the past. (Chorus) I had a dream, I had a dream, A world of unity, where we all could be, No more discrimination, no more segregation, We stand as one, in this new foundation. (Verse 2) Four little kids, hand in hand, side by side, No matter the color, race, or divide, A land where freedom rings, from the mountain tops, Together we'll rise, ain't no way we'll stop. From Alabama to Mississippi, we break the chains, Fighting for justice, no more bloodstains, For freedom and equality, we'll march all day, 'Cause Dr. King taught us, there's a better way. (Bridge) This dream ain't just for me and you, It's for our children, and their children too, So let's take a stand, and make this dream come true, Together we'll rise, ain't nothin' we can't do. (Chorus) I had a dream, I had a dream, A world of unity, where we all could be, No more discrimination, no more segregation, We stand as one, in this new foundation. (Verse 3) Now we livin' in a world, where change is near, But the fight ain't over, gotta persevere, For love, and unity, we'll keep moving on, 'Cause the dream of Dr. King will never be gone. From every city, every village, and every hood, We'll keep pushing forward, just like we should, The dream of freedom, equality, and love, That's the vision, sent from up above. (Outro) So let's remember, the dream he once had, Martin Luther King, a legacy that stands, Together we'll rise, for a brighter day, And his dream will live on, in every step we take. (Chorus) I had a dream, I had a dream, A world of unity, where we all could be, No more discrimination, no more segregation, We stand as one, in this new foundation.
