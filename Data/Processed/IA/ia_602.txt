what is the difference between antigens and antibodies

Antigens and antibodies are two essential components of the immune system that play important roles in protecting the body against infectious diseases. An antigen is any substance that can trigger an immune response in the body. Antigens are typically foreign molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids found on the surface of bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms. When an antigen enters the body, it is recognized by the immune system as foreign and activates an immune response, which includes the production of antibodies. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of antigens. Antibodies are designed to bind to specific antigens, and they can recognize and neutralize viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. Antibodies are produced by a type of white blood cell called B cells, and they come in several different types or classes, such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. Each class of antibody has a different function and plays a different role in the immune response. In summary, antigens are foreign molecules that trigger an immune response, while antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system to recognize and neutralize antigens.

I have seen the term antigen used to describe protein clusters on cancer cells. But some of these antigens are also found on non-cancerous cells. Is that correct? If so, do you consider this type of antigen a foreign substance?

Yes, you are correct that some antigens found on cancer cells are also present on non-cancerous cells. These antigens are known as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) or tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), and they can be proteins, carbohydrates, or other molecules that are overexpressed or mutated in cancer cells. Although TAAs are not foreign substances per se, they can still be recognized by the immune system as different from the body's normal cells. The immune system has mechanisms to distinguish self from non-self, and cancer cells with altered or overexpressed antigens may be recognized as abnormal or aberrant, leading to an immune response. However, cancer cells can develop ways to evade the immune system's recognition and attack, such as by downregulating the expression of TAAs or by producing immune suppressive factors. This is one of the challenges in developing effective cancer immunotherapies that can boost the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy cancer cells. In summary, tumor-associated antigens found on cancer cells may not be foreign substances, but they can still be recognized by the immune system as abnormal or different from the body's normal cells, and they can potentially be targeted by cancer immunotherapies.
