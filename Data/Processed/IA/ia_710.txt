{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Can you check the following paragraph, which is enclosed by a double quote for grammar mistakes, and provide a revised paragraph — "Feedback is inherent in engineering education for teachers to provide comments about their students’ work. It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022). However, there is little understanding of the potential use of an AI-automated feedback tool for feedback to engineering students. In this research, surveys will be conducted and analyzed to examine the benefits of an AI feedback tool in engineering education."'}

Students receive feedback from teachers on assessments and provide peer evaluations to other students.

This tool can help students enhance their feedback literacy, understand and create dispositions from feedback, and become self-paced in their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018; Tubino & Adachi, 2022).
