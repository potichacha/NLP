Find the x-intercept of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point where the graph of f crosses the y-axis. f(x)=(4x-1)^2 * (3x+2)^2

To find the x-intercept of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point where the graph of f crosses the y-axis, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Find the coordinates of the point where f crosses the y-axis. The graph of a function f(x) crosses the y-axis when x = 0. So, we need to find f(0): f(0) = (4 0 + 2)^2 = (-1)^2 * (2)^2 = 1 * 4 = 4 So, the point where f crosses the y-axis is (0, 4). Step 2: Find the derivative of f(x). f(x) = (4x - 1)^2 * (3x + 2)^2 Apply the product rule and chain rule: f'(x) = 2(4x - 1)(4)(3x + 2)^2 + 2(3x + 2)(3)(4x - 1)^2 Step 3: Evaluate the derivative at the x-coordinate of the point where f crosses the y-axis. f'(0) = 2(-1)(4)(2)^2 + 2(2)(3)(-1)^2 = -32 + 12 = -20 So, the slope of the tangent line at the point (0, 4) is -20. Step 4: Use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the tangent line. The point-slope form of a linear equation is: y - y1 = m(x - x1) Plug in the slope m = -20, and the point (0, 4): y - 4 = -20(x - 0) Simplify: y = -20x + 4 Step 5: Set the y-value of the tangent line equation to 0 and solve for x to find the x-intercept. 0 = -20x + 4 Add 20x to both sides: 20x = 4 Divide by 20: x = 1/5 So, the x-intercept of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point where the graph of f crosses the y-axis is x = 1/5.
