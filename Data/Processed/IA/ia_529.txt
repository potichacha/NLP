My sister works for a beer brewery called Goofy Foot Tap room (a reference to backwards stances on a skateboard, snowboard, etc). Could suggest a recipe for a blackberry sour beer along with name for the beer that reflects the theme of the brewery?

Recipe: Goofy Foot Blackberry Fakie Sour Ingredients: Instructions: Name: "Switch Stance Blackberry Shred" This name plays on the "Goofy Foot" theme, incorporating skateboarding terminology ("switch stance" and "shred") to create a fun and unique beer name that connects to the brewery\
