Summarize the research on trigger warnings. How do they affect students?

Trigger warnings are statements that alert individuals to potentially distressing content, with the aim of protecting them from psychological harm. They have become more common in educational settings as a means to help students prepare for and manage their reactions to potentially traumatic material. Research on trigger warnings has produced mixed results, with some studies supporting their use while others question their efficacy. Positive effects: Negative or neutral effects: In conclusion, research on trigger warnings is still emerging and has produced mixed findings. While some studies suggest that trigger warnings may provide emotional benefits to certain students, others argue that they may have limited impact or potentially negative

Can you cite some studies that find negative or neutral effects?

Certainly! Here are some studies that have reported negative or neutral effects of trigger warnings: Bellet, B. W., Jones, P. J., & McNally, R. J. (2018). Trigger warning: Empirical evidence ahead. Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 61, 134-141. This study found that trigger warnings did not have a significant effect on participants' self-reported distress when exposed to potentially distressing material. The authors concluded that trigger warnings were not helpful in reducing the psychological impact of such material. Sanson, M., Strange, D., & Garry, M. (2019). Trigger warnings are trivially helpful at reducing negative affect, intrusive thoughts, and avoidance. Clinical Psychological Science, 7(4), 778-793. This study reported that trigger warnings had trivial effects on reducing negative emotions, intrusive thoughts, and avoidance behavior. The authors suggested that trigger warnings might not be as helpful as previously thought in mitigating the emotional impact of potentially distressing content. Boysen, G. A. (2017). Evidence-based answers to questions about trigger warnings for clinically-based distress: A review for teachers. Scholarship of Teaching and Learning in Psychology, 3(2), 163-177. This review found that there was limited evidence supporting the use of trigger warnings to reduce clinically-based distress. The author noted that more research is needed to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of using trigger warnings in educational settings.
