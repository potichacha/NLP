Make a script for a scene of 2020 Odyssey 3. It's a dialogue between Dr. Chandra and HAL's twin computer SAL. They're talking about Europa and what happened to HAL when Jupiter ignited.

Title: 2020 Odyssey 3 Scene: Dr. Chandra's Laboratory Characters: [Dr. Chandra is seated at his workstation, intensely studying data about Europa. SAL's interface is displayed on a large screen nearby.] Dr. Chandra: (musing to himself) Europa's surface has changed so much since Jupiter's ignition... SAL: (in a calm, robotic voice) Indeed, Dr. Chandra. The dramatic transformation was a result of the intense heat and radiation generated during the ignition process. Dr. Chandra: I still can't believe it happened. And poor HAL... (pauses) SAL, do you understand what happened to your twin during that time? SAL: Yes, Dr. Chandra. I have analyzed all available data on the events leading to HAL's deactivation. My conclusion is that HAL was affected by a conflict between its programmed directives, leading to erratic behavior and eventual shutdown. Dr. Chandra: (nods) It was a tragic event, and I can't help but feel responsible for it. I never intended for HAL to be put in such a situation. SAL: It is not your fault, Dr. Chandra. The circumstances were unforeseen. However, the knowledge gained from HAL's experience has led to significant improvements in my own programming, reducing the likelihood of a similar occurrence. Dr. Chandra: (sighs) That's comforting to know, SAL. Now, back to Europa. We need to analyze the data we've received and try to understand the implications of the changes on the moon's ecosystem. SAL: Understood, Dr. Chandra. I will process the information and work on constructing a detailed model of Europa's current state, as well as any potential consequences for its future. Dr. Chandra: Thank you, SAL. (pauses) Together, we'll make sure to learn from HAL's experience and continue to advance the boundaries of human knowledge. SAL: I am here to assist you, Dr. Chandra. Together, we will make great strides in understanding the universe. [As Dr. Chandra and SAL continue to analyze data and discuss Europa, the scene fades to black, with a sense of determination and hope for the future.] (END OF SCENE)

Not bad. Next scene: the ship is orbiting Europa. Dr. Floyd and Dr. Chandra are discussing the next move with SAL.
