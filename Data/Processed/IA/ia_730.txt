He stops to pick up a new video game featuring himself on the cover. LEON (Chuckling) Never thought I'd end up like this. Suddenly, a loud CRASH is heard from the entrance. SHOPPERS panic and scatter. A hulking figure emerges through the smoke and debris - NEMESIS. NEMESIS S.T.A.R.S... Leon spots Nemesis and readies his pistol, taking cover behind a shelf. LEON (Whispering) Not here, not now... INT. WALMART - CLOTHING SECTION - DAY Leon sneaks through the clothing section, trying to stay hidden from Nemesis.
