Im a programmer, how do I program my website to use user's microphone from browser on any machine

To access a user's microphone from their browser, you can use the Web Audio API and the MediaDevices.getUserMedia() method. This is supported by modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Here's a simple example to access the user's microphone and stream the audio input: In this example, the audio input from the microphone is simply connected to the audio output, so you'll hear the audio through the speakers or headphones. You can further process the audio stream according to your needs. Please note that getUserMedia() requires the site to be served over HTTPS, or accessed via localhost during development. For more advanced use cases, you can check out the official Web Audio API documentation:
