Suggest a business model for an online based investment manager that specializes in systematic based algorithm strategies

One potential business model for an online-based investment manager that specializes in systematic-based algorithm strategies is a subscription-based service. This could involve charging clients a monthly or annual fee for access to the investment algorithms, which they can then use to manage their own portfolios. The investment manager could also offer additional services such as personalized portfolio management, performance tracking, and reporting for an additional fee. Additionally, the company could generate revenue through a performance fee, where clients pay a percentage of the returns generated by the investment algorithms.

We would like to also integrate various brokers and custodians and automate trade execution

A possible business model that incorporates the integration of various brokers and custodians, as well as the automation of trade execution, is a robo-advisory platform. In this model, clients would create accounts on the platform, and then link it to their brokerage and custodial accounts. The robo-advisory platform would then use the client's account information and the systematic-based algorithm strategies to automatically execute trades on the client's behalf. The platform could charge a management fee, which would cover the cost of maintaining the platform, offering customer service, and executing trades. Additionally, the platform could charge a performance fee, which would be based on the returns generated by the algorithm strategies. This fee structure allows the platform to generate revenue while aligning its interests with those of its clients. Another way to generate revenue would be through partnerships with custodians, brokers, or other financial institutions. Platform could receive a referral fee or a revenue share for every new client directed to them.
