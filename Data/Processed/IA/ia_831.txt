java communication over wifi

Java can be used to communicate over WiFi using various networking libraries available in Java. One way to establish a WiFi connection in Java is to use the Socket class. A Socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines. To use the Socket class, you first need to create a server on the host machine that listens for incoming connections. Once a client connects to the server

generate code to communicate over socket

Sure, here is an example code for establishing a socket connection in Java: Server side: Client side: In this example, the server listens for incoming connections on port 8080. When a client connects, the server creates a PrintWriter to send data to the client and a BufferedReader to receive data from the client. The server reads data from the client and sends a response back. The client connects to the server using the server's IP address and port number, and creates a PrintWriter to send data to the server and a BufferedReader to receive data from the server. The client reads input from the user and sends it to the server, and then waits for a response from the server.

using c++

Sure! Here's an example of how to establish a socket connection in C++ using the Berkeley sockets API: Server side: Client side:

Complete it

Here's the completed code for the client side: This client code creates a socket, sets the address and port of the server to connect to, connects to the server, sends a message to the server, receives data from the server, prints the received data to the console, and closes the socket. Note that the server must be running before running this client code.
