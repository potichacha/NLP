explain analysing data with unix tools

There are several Unix tools that can be used for analyzing data, including: grep : searches for a specific string or pattern in a file or multiple files. sed : a stream editor that can be used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). awk : a programming language that is often used for text processing and data extraction. cut : cuts out sections from each line of a file. sort : sorts the lines of a file. uniq : removes duplicate lines from a sorted file. wc : counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. pipes  : allows to connect multiple commands together so that the output of one command can be used as the input to another command. For example, using  grep  to find all the lines in a file that contain a specific word,  sed  to replace a word with another one in the output,  awk  to print specific columns from the output,  sort  to sort the output,  uniq  to remove duplicate lines and  wc  to count the number of lines, words and characters in the final output.

explain analysing data with hadoop

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets. It can be used for analyzing data in several ways: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System): HDFS stores large data sets across multiple machines, allowing for distributed processing of the data. MapReduce: Hadoop's programming model for processing large data sets. It consists of two functions: the map function, which processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and the reduce function, which merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Hive: a data warehousing and SQL-like query language that runs on top of Hadoop. It allows for querying and managing large datasets using a SQL-like syntax. Pig: a high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs used with Hadoop. It provides a simple programming model for analyzing large data sets. Spark: a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system for big data processing. It can be used with Hadoop to process data in a distributed computing environment. Hbase: a NoSQL database that runs on top of Hadoop and HDFS. It allows for the storage and retrieval of large amounts of data in a distributed and fault-tolerant way. All these tools can be used together to analyze large datasets stored in HDFS using MapReduce, Hive, Pig or Spark, and store the results in Hbase.
