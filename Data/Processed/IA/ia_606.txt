{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! Here's an implementation of the  addEdge  function for the  MyGraph  class in C++: This function takes in three parameters: the source vertex, the target vertex, and the weight of the edge between them. It first checks if the source vertex already exists in the graph (i.e., if it has any adjacent vertices). If it doesn't, it creates a new adjacency list for the source vertex and increments the number of vertices in the graph. It then adds the target vertex and weight as a new pair to the source vertex's adjacency list. Finally, it checks if the target vertex exists in the graph and adds it if it doesn't (since this is an undirected graph, we need to make sure that both vertices are present in the graph)."}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "This graph is undirected so don't you need to add the edge twice?"}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Yes, you are correct. In an undirected graph, adding an edge from vertex A to vertex B also implies an edge from vertex B to vertex A. Therefore, we need to add the edge twice, with the source and target vertices swapped. Here's the modified  addEdge  function that adds the edge twice for an undirected graph: This function adds the edge from the source to the target as before, and then checks if the target vertex exists in the graph. If it doesn't, it creates a new adjacency list for the target vertex and increments the number of vertices in the graph. Finally, it adds the edge again with the source and target vertices swapped to ensure that the graph is undirected."}

The first line print the number of vertices. 2. Each subsequent line prints an edge. It should print three numbers: the two vertices associated with the edge (print the vertex with the smaller number first), and the weight of the edge. You should have one space character between the numbers, and no space at the end. You can order the edges whatever way you want.'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! Here's an implementation of a  printGraph  function for the  MyGraph  class in C++: This function takes in an output stream ( out ) as a parameter and outputs the graph to it in the format specified. It first prints the number of vertices in the graph on a new line. Then, it iterates over each vertex in the graph and its adjacency list. For each vertex, it iterates over each adjacent vertex and its weight. It prints the edge if the source vertex is smaller than the target vertex (to avoid printing the same edge twice). The output format is as follows: You can call this function on an
