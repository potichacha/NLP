8 / 8Write in other words, in short: AI systems of the 2020s will not be built because of better modeling but because of larger and cleaner datasets representing more challenging tasks

The success of AI systems in the 2020s will rely less on improved modeling techniques and more on the availability of bigger and more refined datasets that can represent complex tasks.

To achieve advancements in AI, reliance on larger and more refined datasets is critical rather than just improving modeling techniques. Alternative options:

What about "The key to building successful AI systems in the upcoming years will depend more on high-quality datasets and challenging tasks rather than improved modeling techniques". How is that? + suggest several rephrases

"The success of AI systems in the near future hinges on the availability of high-quality datasets that can tackle challenging tasks, rather than just improving modeling techniques." Alternative options:

What are some ways to choose useful multimodal data? What steps can be taken to create a scalable open-source Vision and Language (V&L) model? How can large language models be utilized to generate textual analogies? How can multimodal bottlenecks be identified in models that handle more than just Vision and Language?
