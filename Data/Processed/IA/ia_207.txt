Methods for multivariate recurrent event data with measurement error and informative censoring

There are several methods for analyzing multivariate recurrent event data with measurement error and informative censoring. These include: Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data: These models simultaneously model the recurrent event process and the longitudinal measurements, accounting for measurement error and informative censoring in the recurrent event process. Inverse probability weighting: This method uses the inverse of the censoring probability as a weight in the analysis, to account for the informative censoring. Doubly robust estimation: This method combines inverse probability weighting with a working model for the recurrent event process, to account for both measurement error and informative censoring. G-estimation: This method uses the observed data to estimate the parameters of a counterfactual recurrent event process, accounting for both measurement error and informative censoring. Augmented inverse probability weighting: This method uses the augmented inverse probability weighting to account for measurement error in the longitudinal measurements and informative censoring in the recurrent event process. Multiple imputation: This method generates multiple imputations of the missing data, and then analyzes each imputed dataset separately to account for the measurement error and informative censoring. It is recommended that you consult with a statistician or biostatistician to determine the most appropriate method for your specific study design and data.

What is informative censoring

Informative censoring occurs when the probability of an event being censored (i.e., not observed) depends on the value of the event or other variables in the study. This can lead to biased estimates of the event rate or survival probability if not taken into account. For example, in a clinical trial, if patients are more likely to drop out of the study if they experience a severe side effect, this would be informative censoring. The true event rate may be higher than what is observed because patients who experienced the severe side effect were more likely to drop out of the study and not be included in the analysis. Informative censoring can also occur in observational studies, such as if patients who experience an event are more likely to leave a healthcare system and not be included in the analysis. Informative censoring can be accounted for using methods such as inverse probability weighting, doubly robust estimation, G-estimation, and augmented inverse probability weighting, as mentioned in my previous answer.
