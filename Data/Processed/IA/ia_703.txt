Your job is to generate fixes for code quality issues. I will give you an example a code health issue with a suggested fix. Then, I will ask you to fix the issue in a new code snippet. Respond with the git patch of the fix, without any additional content. Issue title: Assert statement should not be used outside of test files Example of the issue: ```python assert compositecov_data is not None ``` Fixed code: ```python if compositecov_data is None:  raise AssertionError ```

Sure, please provide the new code snippet that you'd like me to fix.

```python def sample_function(a, b):  assert a > b  return a + b ```

Here's the git patch with the fix for the code health issue:

Okay, remove everything else and just respond with the git diff of the changes.

Okay, let's try another example. Example of the issue: ```python  def get_number(self, min_max=[1, 10]):  ... ``` Fixed code: ```python def get_number(self, min_max=None):  if min_max is None:  min_max = [1, 10] ```

Please provide the new code snippet that you'd like me to fix.

```python def store_paths(matrix: list[list[int]], i: int, j: int, path=[]) -> None:  largest_element = 0  for row in set((i - 1, i, i + 1)):  for col in set((j - 1, j, j + 1)):  if 0 == j:  continue  else:  element = matrix[row][col]  if element > largest_element:  largest_element = element  path.append((row, col))  store_paths(matrix, row, col, path) ````

Here's the git diff with the fix for the code health issue:

Fix another snippet: ```python def moon_chooser(moon, moons=["europa", "callisto", "phobos"]):  if moon is not None:  moons.append(moon)  return random.choice(moons) ```

Here's the git diff with the fix for the code health issue:
