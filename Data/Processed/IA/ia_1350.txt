What is Hyper-Calvinism?

Hyper-Calvinism is a theological perspective within the Reformed tradition that places a strong emphasis on the sovereignty of God in salvation, to the point where it denies the need for evangelism and the offer of the Gospel to all people. Hyper-Calvinists believe that God predestines individuals to salvation or damnation, and that those who are chosen will inevitably be saved without any effort on their part. They may argue that evangelism is unnecessary because those who are not chosen by God are already condemned and cannot be saved, regardless of any human effort. This view is often seen as an extreme form of Calvinism, as it emphasizes the idea that God's sovereignty in salvation means that humans have no role to play in their own salvation or in bringing others to faith. Many within the Reformed tradition reject Hyper-Calvinism as it seems to undermine the importance of evangelism and the offer of the Gospel to all people.

Does Hyper-Calvinism agree with the teachings of the Bible Fellowship Church?

It would be difficult to make a definitive statement about whether Hyper-Calvinism agrees with the teachings of the Bible Fellowship Church without a more detailed analysis of the specific beliefs and practices of the denomination in question. However, in general, many churches within the Reformed tradition would likely reject Hyper-Calvinism as an extreme form of Calvinism that goes beyond the teachings of the Bible and undermines the importance of evangelism and mission. The Bible Fellowship Church is a conservative evangelical denomination that traces its roots back to the Anabaptist and Pietist movements of the 16th and 17th centuries. While the Bible Fellowship Church affirms the sovereignty of God in salvation, it also emphasizes the importance of evangelism and reaching out to those who have not yet heard the Gospel. Therefore, it is possible that the Bible Fellowship Church would not fully agree with the teachings of Hyper-Calvinism, particularly with regard to the importance of evangelism and mission. However, this would depend on the specific beliefs and practices of individual churches within the denomination.

Would a person preaching Hyper-Calvinism likely believe a person in the Bible Fellowship Church is saved by God?
