Tell me about CITGO

CITGO is a US-based refiner, transporter, and marketer of transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals, and other industrial products. The company was founded in 1910 as the Cities Service Company and was later renamed CITGO Petroleum Corporation in 1965. CITGO is owned by Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), the state-owned oil company of Venezuela. As a result, CITGO has had a long-standing relationship with Venezuela and has been a significant importer of Venezuelan crude oil into the United States. CITGO operates three refineries in the United States located in Louisiana, Illinois, and Texas. The company has a significant presence in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, which is a major hub for the refining and transportation of petroleum products. In recent years, CITGO has faced financial difficulties due to its ownership by PDVSA, which has been mired in corruption and mismanagement scandals, as well as U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. These challenges have made it difficult for CITGO to access financing and maintain its operations, leading to concerns about the company's long-term viability.
