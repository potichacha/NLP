I need to create a component that mounts with animation

Sure! There are several ways you can add animation to a React component. Here's one approach using the React Transition Group library. First, you'll need to install the React Transition Group library: Then, you can create your component as follows: In this example, the  CSSTransition  component is used to animate the mounting and unmounting of the  your-component  div. The  in  prop is used to determine whether the component should be displayed, and the  timeout  prop is used to specify the duration of the animation. The  classNames  prop is used to specify the CSS class that should be applied to the component during the animation. You'll need to create a CSS file that defines the animation styles. Here's an example: This CSS file defines a simple fade-in animation that lasts for 500 milliseconds. That's it! You can now use your  YourComponent  component, and it will be mounted with animation.

How much react-transition-group will add to my bundle size?

The exact amount that  react-transition-group  will add to your bundle size depends on several factors, such as the size of your application, the number of components you use from the library, and your build configuration. However, as of the latest version (4.4.2), the minified production bundle size of  react-transition-group  is around 5.5KB. This is a relatively small size, and it's likely that the benefits of using the library (such as easier animation management and better performance) will outweigh the added size. If you're concerned about bundle size, you can use tools like Tree shaking, Code splitting and other optimization techniques to minimize the amount of code that is included in your final bundle. Additionally, you can also consider using alternative libraries or approaches for handling animations in React, such as using CSS transitions or animations directly, using the  react-spring  library, or creating your own custom animation logic.
