Two hearts that beat as one, A doctor and his sporty bride, Their love for each other has just begun, As they prepare to take the leap and become a team. She's French, he's Norwegian, But their differences they do not mind, For they have found in each other, A love of a different kind. She knows many languages and is writing a PhD, On the power of solar energy, While he heals the sick and saves the day, With his medical proficiency. They are both smart and caring, And they share a common goal, To make the world a better place, With their love and their heart and soul. So here's to the happy couple, As they start their life together, May their love continue to grow and thrive, Now and forever and ever.
