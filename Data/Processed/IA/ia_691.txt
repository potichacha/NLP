is there a piece of farming equipment that is able to remove loose rocks and stones from pastures

Yes, there are several types of farming equipment that are designed specifically for removing loose rocks and stones from pastures. One common type of equipment is a rock rake, which is a heavy-duty tool that uses long, flexible tines to rake up rocks and other debris from the soil. Another piece of equipment commonly used for this purpose is a stone picker, which is a machine that rolls over the pasture, collecting rocks and stones with a rotating drum or series of bars. The collected rocks are then deposited into a hopper or bucket for disposal or reuse. There are also specialized attachments for tractors and skid-steer loaders that can be used for rock removal, such as rock buckets and rock grapples. These tools are designed to scoop up and remove rocks of various sizes and can be useful for larger-scale pasture management. It's important to note that while removing rocks and stones can improve the safety and productivity of a pasture, it's also important to maintain soil health by not removing all of the stones, as they can help with drainage and soil structure.

are there any for pebbles

Yes, there are also farming equipment designed specifically for removing pebbles from pastures. One such equipment is a pebble or stone separator, which separates the smaller stones or pebbles from the soil. This equipment works by passing the soil through a series of screens or sieves that separate the smaller stones or pebbles from the soil. Another type of equipment that can be used for removing pebbles is a soil sifter, which sifts the soil and separates the pebbles or stones from the finer soil particles. This equipment can be hand-held or attached to a tractor, depending on the size of the area that needs to be sifted. It's important to note that pebbles or small stones can be beneficial to soil health, especially for drainage and aeration. Therefore, it's important to strike a balance between removing excessive amounts of pebbles or stones and retaining enough to maintain soil health.
