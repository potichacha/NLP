explain this code briefly  public class Sample f @Bean("encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1") //As part of recipe, check if bean has a name. If not, update the annotation to give a unique name @Primary public EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptorcompositeEncryptor(AppProtectEncryptorappProtectEncryptor,KmsEncryptorheraEncryptor){ LinkedHashMap

This Java code defines a class named  Sample  with two methods. The primary goal of the code is to create and configure an encryption and decryption mechanism for different types of data using different encryption strategies. public EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor compositeEncryptor(AppProtectEncryptor appProtectEncryptor, KmsEncryptor heraEncryptor) : This method creates an instance of  EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor  by using different  Encryptor  instances. It takes two arguments -  appProtectEncryptor  and  heraEncryptor . It also uses a custom encryptor. The method creates a  LinkedHashMap  named  patternToEncryptorsMap  to map different patterns to their respective encryptors. Finally, it returns a new instance of  EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor  with the  patternToEncryptorsMap  and a  DefaultNoopEncryptor . public EncryptionFactory encryptionFactory(@Qualifier("encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1") Encryptor encryptor) : This method creates an instance of  EncryptionFactory . It takes a single argument -  encryptor  of type  Encryptor , which is qualified by the name "encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1". The method defines an anonymous subclass of  EncryptionFactory  with three overridden methods: The code uses Spring annotations such as  @Bean ,  @Primary , and  @Qualifier  to create and configure Spring beans.

what does the @Qualifier do here in basic terms

In basic terms, the  @Qualifier  annotation is used to help Spring identify which specific bean should be injected when multiple beans of the same type exist in the application context. It allows you to provide a unique identifier or name for the desired bean, so that Spring knows exactly which one to use when resolving dependencies. In the provided code,  @Qualifier("encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1")  is used to specify that the  Encryptor  bean with the name "encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1" should be injected as the argument for the  encryptionFactory  method. This ensures that the correct  Encryptor  instance is used when creating the  EncryptionFactory  bean.
