We are going to build a battery backup circuit for a PCB that is normally powered by a 5-volt power supply. Our battery backup can only connect to the 5V and GND planes on this PCB. The backup circuit should charge the battery when the PCB is receiving power from the external power supply. When the external power supply fails, power should be supplied from the battery. Design the external battery backup circuit. Describe its components and how they are connected.

To design an external battery backup circuit for a PCB that is normally powered by a 5-volt power supply, we can use the following components: Here is a step-by-step description of how to connect these components to create the battery backup circuit: Connect Diode D1 between the 5V input of the PCB and the output of the voltage regulator (U1). This diode ensures that when the external power supply is connected, power is supplied to the PCB and prevents reverse current flow from the battery into the voltage regulator. Connect the output of the voltage regulator (U1) to the 5V plane of the PCB. The voltage regulator ensures that the PCB receives a stable 5V supply, regardless of whether it is powered by the external power supply or the battery. Connect the ground pin of the voltage regulator (U1) to the GND plane of the PCB. Connect Diode D2 between the 5V input of the PCB and the charging circuit (U2) input. This diode ensures that the charging circuit only receives power when the external power supply is connected. Connect the charging circuit (U2) to the battery (BAT). The charging circuit is responsible for safely charging the battery when the external power supply is connected. Choose a charging circuit compatible with the battery type you are using (e.g., Li-ion, NiMH, or lead-acid). Connect the battery (BAT) to the input of the voltage regulator (U1). This connection ensures that the battery supplies power to the PCB when the external power supply is disconnected. Add capacitors C1 and C2 to the input and output of the voltage regulator (U1), respectively. These capacitors help stabilize the voltage regulator and filter any noise in the power supply lines. Typical values for these capacitors are 10uF to 100uF, but you should refer to the voltage regulator's datasheet for specific recommendations. Once the components are connected as described, the battery backup circuit will charge the battery when the PCB is receiving power from the external power supply. When the external power supply fails, power will be supplied from the battery, ensuring uninterrupted operation of the PCB.

We cannot make any connections to the 5V input of the original PCB, only the 5V power plane. How can we do this?
