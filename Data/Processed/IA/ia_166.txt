OpenAI’s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for: Search (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string) Clustering (where text strings are grouped by similarity) Recommendations (where items with related text strings are recommended) Anomaly detection (where outliers with little relatedness are identified) Diversity measurement (where similarity distributions are analyzed) Classification (where text strings are classified by their most similar label) An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness. Visit our pricing page to learn about Embeddings pricing. Requests are billed based on the number of tokens in the input sent. To see embeddings in action, check out our code samples Classification Topic clustering Search Recommendations How to get embeddings To get an embedding, send your text string to the embeddings API endpoint along with a choice of embedding model ID (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002). The response will contain an embedding, which you can extract, save, and use.

When using OpenAI embeddings, please keep in mind their limitations and risks. Embedding models OpenAI offers one second-generation embedding model (denoted by -002 in the model ID) and 16 first-generation models (denoted by -001 in the model ID). We recommend using text-embedding-ada-002 for nearly all use cases. It’s better, cheaper, and simpler to use. Read the blog post announcement.
