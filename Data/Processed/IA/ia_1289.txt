what is the process that begins with revolution and then spawns rigid institutions that resist change resulting in subsequent revolutions

The process you are referring to is a cycle of revolution and institutionalization, which can be observed in various social, political, and economic contexts. This cycle consists of the following stages: Discontent and agitation: Widespread dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs, often due to social, political, or economic inequality, oppression, or other grievances, leads to agitation and the demand for change among the population. Revolution: The mounting discontent and desire for change culminates in a revolution, which can be either peaceful or violent. A revolution is a fundamental shift in the political or social order, often involving the overthrow of an established authority or power structure. New institutions and consolidation: After the revolution, new institutions are established to replace the old ones. This can include the creation of new political systems, social structures, or economic arrangements. The new order consolidates its power, often with the intention of addressing the grievances that led to the revolution in the first place. Institutional rigidity and resistance to change: Over time, the new institutions become rigid and resistant to change. This can be due to various factors, such as entrenched interests, bureaucratic inertia, or ideological dogmatism. As these institutions resist change, they may start to reproduce some of the same conditions that led to the initial revolution, such as inequality or oppression. Renewed discontent and agitation: As dissatisfaction with the new institutions grows, the cycle begins anew with renewed calls for change and potential new revolutions. This cycle can be observed in various historical examples, such as the French Revolution and the subsequent rise and fall of various political regimes in France, or the Russian Revolution and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union.
