give an example of an first order system

A classic example of a first-order system is a mass-spring-damper system. It consists of a mass that is attached to a spring and a damper. The spring resists the displacement of the mass and the damper resists the velocity of the mass. The dynamics of this system can be described by a first-order differential equation, which governs the behavior of the mass based on the spring force and damping force acting on it.

visual

Here is a simple visual representation of a mass-spring-damper system: [mass]---[spring]---[damper]---[ground] In this diagram, the mass is shown as a rectangular block and is connected to the ground through a spring and a damper. The spring represents the elastic force that opposes the displacement of the mass, and the damper represents the frictional force that opposes the velocity of the mass. The spring and damper work together to regulate the motion of the mass and determine its behavior over time.

shouldnt the spring and the damper be connected in parallel?

Yes, you are correct. The spring and damper should be connected in parallel in the mass-spring-damper system. The correct visual representation is as follows: [mass] | [spring]---[damper] | [ground]
