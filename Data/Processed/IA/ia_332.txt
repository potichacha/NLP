Write a java class named Fibbo. It has only one method named next. The method receives a number and return the next one in the Fibonacci sequence.

Sure, here's a Java class named  Fibbo  that implements the  next  method to return the next number in the Fibonacci sequence. Here's how you could use the  Fibbo  class to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence: In the  next  method, we keep track of the previous and current numbers in the sequence using  prev  and  curr  instance variables. If the input  n  is 0, we reset  prev  and  curr  to their initial values of 0 and 1 and return 0. If  n  is 1, we return 1. Otherwise, we calculate the next number in the sequence by adding  prev  and  curr , updating  prev  and  curr , and returning the new value of  curr .

Write a unit test using JUnit, for the Fibbo class.

Sure, here's an example JUnit test for the  Fibbo  class: This test uses the  assertEquals  method from JUnit's assertion library to compare the expected values with the actual values returned by the  next  method for various inputs. The  @Test  annotation indicates that this method is a JUnit test. When you run this test, JUnit will create an instance of the  Fibbo  class and call its  next  method with various inputs. It will then compare the expected and actual values using the  assertEquals  method, and report any failures. In this case, if any of the  assertEquals  calls fail, JUnit will report an error message indicating which assertion failed and what the expected and actual values were. Note that this is just an example test, and you may want to add more tests to cover edge cases and other scenarios.

Improve the test paying attention to the "Equivalence class partitioning" technique
