write a short story - including dialog - about a misunderstood and bullied middle school boy who goes back in time and watches his dad being verbally and physically bullied as well. When he returns to the present, he has a greater empathy for his dad

Tommy had always been the target of bullies at school. No matter how hard he tried to fit in, he was always picked on and made fun of. He didn't understand why the other kids treated him this way, and he often felt like he was all alone. One day, as he was walking home from school, he stumbled upon an old watch in the bushes. As he picked it up, he noticed that it was ticking backwards. Confused, he decided to put it on and suddenly found himself transported back in time. Tommy looked around and saw his dad, who was also a middle school student at the time, getting bullied by a group of kids. They were pushing him around, calling him names, and taunting him. Tommy watched in horror as his dad tried to defend himself, but was ultimately overpowered. As he watched, Tommy began to feel a deep sense of empathy for his dad. He realized that his dad had gone through the same thing he was going through, and it made him feel a little less alone. When he returned to the present, he couldn't stop thinking about what he had seen. He went straight to his dad and hugged him, telling him how much he loved him and how sorry he was for not understanding what he had gone through. His dad was surprised by Tommy's sudden outburst of affection, but he was happy to hear that his son finally understood him. They talked for a long time about the struggles they had both faced in middle school and how they could help each other through tough times in the future. From that day on, Tommy felt a greater connection to his dad. He knew that his dad wasn't just a parent, but a person who had gone through similar struggles and was always there to support him. And as he walked to school the next day, he felt a newfound sense of confidence, knowing that he wasn't alone and that he had his dad by his side.

okay, but include actual dialog rather than just narrating feelings and experiences, use conversation
