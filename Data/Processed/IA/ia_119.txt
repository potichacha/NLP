Explain Black Schoeles Option pricing model to 10 year old

The Black-Scholes option pricing model is a way to figure out how much an option (like a stock option) should cost. It takes into account things like how much the stock is worth, how risky it is, and how long until the option expires. It helps people who buy and sell options know how much they should pay or charge for them. Think of it like a math equation that helps us understand the value of an option.

The formula uses a combination of algebra and calculus to calculate the value of the option. While it can be a bit complex, it is widely used in the financial industry to help determine the fair value of options.
