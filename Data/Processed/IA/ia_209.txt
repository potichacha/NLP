{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Here's a PowerShell script that will do what you're asking for: This script first defines the root directory that you want to start the search from ( $rootDirectory ). It then uses the  Get-ChildItem  cmdlet to get a list of all subdirectories within the root directory. Next, it creates an empty array ( $results ) to store the results of the script. The script then loops through each subdirectory, counts the number of PDF files within that subdirectory, and adds the results to the  $results  array. Finally, the script uses the  Export-Csv  cmdlet to write the results to a CSV file. The  -NoTypeInformation  parameter is used to exclude the type information from the output. This script should work as is, but you may need to modify the  $rootDirectory  variable to point to the correct directory on your system."}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'add a progress indicator'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Sure! You can add a progress indicator to the script by adding a loop counter and displaying the progress after processing each subdirectory. Here\'s the updated script: This script uses the  Write-Progress  cmdlet to display a progress bar while processing the subdirectories. The  -Activity  parameter specifies the activity being performed (in this case, "Processing Subdirectories"), the  -Status  parameter specifies the status text to display (including the current subdirectory being processed and the total number of subdirectories), and the  -PercentComplete  parameter specifies the percentage of the task that has been completed. The script calculates the percentage complete by dividing the current subdirectory count by the total number of subdirectories and multiplying by 100. This value is then passed as the  -PercentComplete  parameter to the  Write-Progress  cmdlet.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! You can add an array of root directories to the script and process each one in turn. Here's the updated script: This script uses an array of root directories ( $rootDirectories ) to process multiple directories. It loops through each root directory, gets a list of subdirectories within that root directory, and processes each subdirectory just as in the previous version of the script. The only difference is that the full path of each subdirectory is now included in the results. This way, you can see which subdirectories belong to which root directory in the final report."}
