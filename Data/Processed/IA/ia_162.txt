Use of LEDs in Thermophotonic coolers

LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) play a key role in thermophotonic cooling. The basic principle of thermophotonic cooling is to convert thermal energy into light, and then convert the light back into a lower-temperature thermal energy using a thermoelectric cooler. LEDs are used to generate the high-intensity light that is necessary for thermophotonic cooling. The LED emits light in the near-infrared region of the spectrum, which is most efficient for cooling. The light is absorbed by a special material called a photonic crystal, which is designed to have high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity. The absorbed light heats up the photonic crystal, causing it to release heat to the thermoelectric cooler, which cools it down. By using LEDs in this way, thermophotonic coolers can achieve high cooling efficiency with a compact and lightweight design. The use of LEDs also allows for a high degree of control over the cooling process, as the intensity of the light can be adjusted to fine-tune the cooling performance. In summary, the use of LEDs in thermophotonic coolers enables efficient and effective cooling by converting thermal energy into light, which is then converted back into a lower-temperature thermal energy using a thermoelectric cooler.
