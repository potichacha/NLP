In today's information-driven society, information literacy is a critical skill for success. However, as technology continues to evolve, it is essential to consider the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in information literacy training. AI literacy is the ability to understand and use AI effectively, efficiently, and ethically, and it is becoming increasingly important as AI is integrated into more aspects of our lives. Including AI literacy training in information literacy training is essential because it enables individuals to fully harness the power of information and technology.

Including AI literacy training in information literacy training can help individuals to navigate these issues and use AI in an ethical and responsible way. Furthermore, AI literacy is becoming increasingly important in the workforce, as AI technologies are integrated into more industries and professions. Individuals with AI literacy skills are in high demand, particularly in the tech industry, where AI is driving innovation and economic growth. By including AI literacy training in information literacy training, educators can help prepare individuals for the future of work and ensure that they have the skills and knowledge to succeed in a rapidly changing job market. In conclusion, including AI literacy training in information literacy training is essential for preparing individuals for success in today's information-driven society. AI is a powerful tool that can help individuals to process and analyze information quickly and efficiently, but it requires an understanding of how it works and its potential applications and limitations. By including AI literacy training in information literacy training, educators can help individuals to fully harness the power of information and technology and prepare them for the future of work.
