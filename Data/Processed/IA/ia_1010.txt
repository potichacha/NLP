I will be providing you with a series of email responses between myself and the clinical school allocation appeals committee. I want you to respond "Understood" after each message until I say "Done"

Understood.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to request a review of the decision made by the Clinical School Allocations Appeals Committee regarding my appeal to change clinical schools. While I appreciate the Committee's consideration of my appeal, I am confused about the reasons given for denying my request. My appeal was based on my role as the primary carer for my father, who is immediate family and has no other family members who are able to provide care. I understand that the Clinical School Allocation policy states that care for a family member that is not immediate family and/or where the primary responsibility for that family member lies elsewhere is a non-acceptable reason for appeal. However, my circumstances do not fall within this category, as my father is my immediate family and I bear primary responsibility for his care. I provided sufficient evidence to support my claim, and I believe that my situation falls outside the extensive list of non-acceptable reasons. As such, I respectfully request that the Committee review my case and provide further information regarding how my appeal does not fulfil the requirements of the allocation policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Understood.

Dear Benjamin,   The feedback from the committee is that the commute between North Melbourne and Footscray is considered minimal, as is North Melbourne to Sunshine if required.   Please let me know if you have further questions.
