Help me, please. Is there any wording I should change in this paragraph? It is notable, that there are quite a low number of negation operations there. We only have 3 negations. This is not an accident, we have written the formula in such a way, that it would translate into a low number of negation operations, as the negation operation is a very expensive operation.  The first negation is not very problematic, as the negation is done on a pretty small automaton. The last negation is also happening after the formula has already been simplified. The most complicated is then the negation in the middle. Indeed, we can see this in \\cref{fig:automata-sturmian-periodic}. We have shown the number of states of all the involved automata there. The automaton, that is negated in the middle consists of 483 states (after simplification)  and after negation this number explodes to 597,468. This automaton then gets somewhat bigger when another small automaton with 25 states is added with a $\\wedge$ operation to 2,307,195 states. Luckily, there are no words that this automaton accepts at all. This can be checked  relatively cheaply by an emptiness check, which Pecan does here before attempting any more complicated simplifications, that may take a long time on such a big automaton. Then Pecan replaces the automaton with an empty automaton consisting of just 1 state. Assigning automata to  the remainder of the formula becomes easy then.

Here are some suggestions for wording changes:

Nice, I applied most of the suggestions now. But the "grows substantially" one is not correct, I think. I want to express that it only gets "somewhat" bigger, so the increase is not so big

I see, thank you for clarifying. In that case, you can use a phrase like "increases somewhat" or "grows to some extent" instead of "gets somewhat bigger." This conveys that there is an increase, but it\
