i have used KNeighborsClassifier for my facial recognition attendance system specify the key points which make it better than others.

KNeighborsClassifier is a popular algorithm for image recognition and classification, and can be effective for facial recognition. Some key points that make KNeighborsClassifier a good choice for facial recognition include: Easy to Implement: KNeighborsClassifier is a simple algorithm to implement, and doesn't require a lot of computational resources. This makes it a good choice for smaller projects and applications. Fast Training Time: The KNeighborsClassifier model has a very fast training time, since it simply stores the training data and does not do any computations until it is time to predict. High Accuracy: KNeighborsClassifier has been shown to be highly accurate for facial recognition, especially when the number of neighbors is set appropriately. Flexible Distance Metrics: KNeighborsClassifier allows for different distance metrics to be used, which can be helpful when dealing with different types of data. Non-Parametric: KNeighborsClassifier is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This can be an advantage in situations where the data is not normally distributed. Robust to Noise: KNeighborsClassifier can be robust to noisy data, since it looks at the k nearest neighbors and takes a majority vote to classify the data. This can help reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points. Overall, KNeighborsClassifier can be a good choice for facial recognition tasks due to its ease of implementation, fast training time, high accuracy, and robustness to noise.

suggest any 2 of other models and how KNeighborsClassifier is better than them
