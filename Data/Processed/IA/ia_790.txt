Write three types of activities for this text (matching, fill in the blanks and open questions): Passover is a special holiday celebrated by Jewish people every year. During Passover, families come together to celebrate and remember their history and traditions. One important part of Passover is the seder meal. The seder is a special dinner held on the first two nights of Passover. During the seder, families read from a special book called the haggadah, which tells the story of the Jewish people's journey out of Egypt. The seder plate is an important part of the meal, and it includes different items that symbolize different parts of the Passover story. Some of these items include matzah, which is a type of flatbread that represents the bread the Jewish people ate when they were leaving Egypt. There is also a roasted bone, which represents the Passover sacrifice, and bitter herbs, which remind us of the hard times the Jewish people went through in Egypt. Another important part of the seder plate is the mixture of apples, nuts, and wine. This mixture represents the mortar that the Jewish people used to make bricks when they were slaves in Egypt. During the seder, families also eat boiled potatoes, which represent the hard work of the Jewish people in Egypt. They also eat lettuce, which represents the springtime and new beginnings. One fun tradition during the seder is the hiding of the afikoman, which is a piece of matzah. The children at the seder look for the afikoman, and the person who finds it gets a prize. The seder also includes singing traditional songs and asking the four questions, which are questions about the Passover story. Guests are often invited to the seder to join in the celebration. At the end of the meal, a cup of wine is set aside for Elijah, who is believed to visit every Jewish home during Passover. Overall, Passover is an important and special time for Jewish families to come together, celebrate their traditions, and remember their history.
