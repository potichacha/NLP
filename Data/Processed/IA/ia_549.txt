px4 Flight mode

PX4 is an open-source autopilot system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that supports various flight modes. Flight modes determine how the UAV will behave in the air, and each mode serves a different purpose. Some common flight modes in PX4 include: Manual: In this mode, the pilot has full control of the UAV. The autopilot system only provides stabilization, but the pilot has to manually control the UAV's movements. Altitude Hold: In this mode, the UAV maintains its altitude and can move in any direction based on the pilot's inputs. The autopilot system stabilizes the UAV's attitude and altitude. Position Hold: In this mode, the UAV maintains its position and altitude, and the pilot can control the UAV's orientation. The autopilot system uses GPS to hold the UAV in place. Waypoint: In this mode, the UAV follows a pre-defined path consisting of several waypoints. The autopilot system controls the UAV's movements and uses GPS to navigate between waypoints. Return to Home (RTH): In this mode, the UAV returns to its takeoff location and lands automatically. The autopilot system uses GPS to navigate back to the takeoff location. Loiter: In this mode, the UAV stays in a particular location and maintains a constant altitude. The autopilot system stabilizes the UAV's attitude and altitude. Acro: In this mode, the UAV can perform aerobatic maneuvers, and the pilot has full control over the UAV's movements. The autopilot system only provides stabilization. These are just a few examples of flight modes available in PX4, and there are many more. The specific flight modes available on a particular UAV may depend on its configuration and the autopilot system used.
