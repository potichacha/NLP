How to brew kombucha at home in a bucket?

Brewing kombucha at home in a bucket is a simple and cost-effective way to make this fermented tea drink. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started: Materials needed: Instructions: Clean and sanitize the bucket: Before starting the brewing process, it is important to clean and sanitize the bucket and all the utensils that will come into contact with the kombucha. You can use a mixture of hot water and white vinegar to sanitize the bucket. Make the sweet tea: Brew a gallon of black or green tea using 8-10 tea bags and 1 cup of granulated sugar. Let the tea cool down to room temperature. Add the scoby and starter tea: Once the sweet tea has cooled down, add the scoby and starter tea to the bucket. Make sure your hands are clean and washed with soap and water before handling the scoby. Cover the bucket with a breathable cloth: Cover the bucket with a piece of cheesecloth or a clean dish towel and secure it with a rubber band. The cloth will keep dust and other contaminants out while allowing air to flow in and out of the bucket. Wait for fermentation: Place the bucket in a warm, dark place, such as a pantry or cupboard. The fermentation process typically takes 7-14 days, depending on the temperature and other factors. Check on the kombucha every few days to make sure that everything is going well. You should start to see a new scoby forming on the surface of the tea. Taste and test the kombucha: After 7-10 days, you can start to taste the kombucha to see if it is ready. Use a wooden or plastic spoon to gently lift the scoby and take a small sample of the tea. If the kombucha tastes too sweet, let it ferment for a few more days. If it tastes too sour, reduce the fermentation time for the next batch. You can also use a pH test strip to check the acidity of the kombucha. It should be between 2.5 and 3.5. Bottle and store the kombucha: Once the kombucha has reached the desired level of acidity, remove the scoby and starter tea from the bucket and transfer the kombucha to glass bottles with tight-fitting lids. You can add fruit juice or other flavorings at this stage if you like. Store the bottles in the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation process. Start a new batch: Once you have bottled the kombucha, you can start a new batch by repeating the process with fresh sweet tea and the new scoby that has formed during the fermentation process. Important note: Always use clean and sanitized utensils and equipment when brewing kombucha to prevent contamination and ensure a healthy fermentation process. If you notice any mold, foul odor, or other signs of contamination, discard the batch and start again with a new scoby and fresh ingredients.
