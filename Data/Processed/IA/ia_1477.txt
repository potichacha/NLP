How setup react-helmet with Server Side Rendering?

React Helmet is a popular library used for managing the title and meta tags of a React application. Server Side Rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering the initial HTML of a web page on the server-side, rather than on the client-side. Setting up React Helmet with SSR can improve SEO and the initial load time of your application. Here's how you can set up React Helmet with SSR: or This component will render the  head  and  body  tags of the HTML, along with the  title ,  meta , and  link  tags generated by React Helmet. It also renders the  css  styles, if they are provided. This code creates a  HelmetProvider  and wraps your React component ( App ) with it. The  HelmetProvider  provides the  Helmet  instance to the React component hierarchy so that it can manage the title and meta tags. The  HelmetProvider  also takes a  context  prop, which is used to capture the  Helmet  instance.
