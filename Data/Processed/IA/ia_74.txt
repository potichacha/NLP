easiest way to read and error check program arguments in cpp

The easiest way to read and error check program arguments in C++ is to use the  argc  and  argv  variables provided by the main function.  argc  is the number of arguments passed to the program, and  argv  is an array of pointers to the arguments. You can use a for loop to iterate through the  argv  array and check each argument. To check for errors, you can use  if  statements to check if the correct number of arguments were passed and if the arguments are in the correct format. Here is an example of how to use argc and argv to read and error check program arguments in C++: In this example, the program first checks if the correct number of arguments (3) were passed. If not, it prints an error message and exits. Then it converts the arguements in argv[1] and argv[2] to int using atoi() function. Next, it checks if the arguments are positive integers and if not, it prints an error message and exits. If the arguments are valid, it prints them.

what is atoi?

atoi()  is a C++ standard library function that stands for "Ascii to Integer". It is used to convert a string of characters representing an integer to an actual integer value. The string of characters can be passed as an argument to the  atoi()  function, and the function will return the corresponding integer value. If the string passed as an argument is not a valid integer, the function will return zero. Here is an example of how  atoi()  function can be used: In this example, the  atoi()  function is used to convert the string "123" to the integer 123. The output will be 123. It\
