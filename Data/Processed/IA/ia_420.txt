craft an http request with every possible header with made up values

Sure! Here's an example HTTP request with every possible header, along with some made-up values: Please note that not all of these headers are required or even commonly used in HTTP requests, and some headers may not be relevant to your specific use case. It's important to understand the purpose and appropriate usage of each header before including it in your requests.

Build a PCRE2 regex that can detect the empty line in this http message contained in a c++ string. ```  std::string http_msg = "POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1\\r "  "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)\\r "  "Host: www.tutorialspoint.com\\r "  "Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8\\r "  "Content-Length: length\\r "  "Accept-Language: en-us\\r "  "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\\r "  "Connection: Keep-Alive\\r "  "\\r "  "\\r "  "string\\r "; ```

Here's a PCRE2 regex pattern that can detect the empty line in the given HTTP message: This pattern matches any line that contains only carriage return and/or line feed characters (i.e., an empty line). The  ^  character matches the beginning of a line,  [\\r ]+  matches one or more carriage return and/or line feed characters, and  $  matches the end of a line. The  ^  and  $  anchors ensure that the pattern matches only the empty line and not any other line that contains only whitespace or other characters. To use this pattern in C++ with PCRE2, you would need to include the PCRE2 header files and use the  pcre2_match()  function to perform the matching. Here's an example:

If PCRE2 isnt the default regex engine used in C++ 17, write a regex that will match the previous string pattern http message.

C++11 and later versions of C++ include the  <regex>  library, which provides support for regular expressions. Here's a regular expression pattern that matches the HTTP message pattern in the given C++ string: This pattern matches the first line of the HTTP message, which contains the request method, URL, and HTTP version, followed by any number of headers, and finally the message body. The pattern uses capture groups to extract the various components of the message. Here's an explanation of the pattern: To use this pattern in C++ with the  <regex>  library, you would need to compile the pattern into a  std::regex  object and use the  std::regex_match()  function to perform the matching. Here's an example:

No I wanted you to write a regular expression that can detect the empty line in the c++ string http message
