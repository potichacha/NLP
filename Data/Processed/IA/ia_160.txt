How to monetize mobile games

There are several ways to monetize mobile games: In-app purchases: Offer virtual or physical goods in exchange for real money within the game. Advertising: Display ads in the game to earn revenue on a cost-per-impression or cost-per-click basis. Freemium model: Offer a free version of the game with in-app purchases or ads, and a premium version with additional features for a fee. Subscription model: Charge a monthly or yearly fee for access to the game's content and features. Cross-promotion: Promote other games to your existing user base to earn revenue from the resulting downloads. It's important to strike a balance between monetization and user experience. Too many ads or intrusive in-app purchases can drive users away, while not monetizing enough can limit the potential revenue of the game.
