In today's society and culture, developing a close relationship between parent and child can be difficult. Often times, parents express that they don't get as much attention or appreciation from their adult children.  Our company would like to create a social movement to encourage adult children to show appreciate to their parents and grandparents and family more often. To do this, we would like to create an essay writing contest. We want candidates to reflect on their parents and write the most inspirational short story. The essay is short and sweet of about 1000 words. Candidates will write their story and post it on their social media and challenge 3 additional friends by tagging them.  Write a prompt for this essay contest. The prompt should help guide the candidates in writing a quality inspiring story. The winner of this contest will receive a $5000 reward to take their parents on a vacation trip wherever they like.

Prompt: "Reflect on the impact your parents or grandparents have had on your life and write a short story about a specific moment or experience that showcases their love, guidance, and support. Share how this moment or experience has shaped who you are today and express your appreciation for them in 1000 words or less. Don\
