The problem can be formulated in a mathematical way. Given a graph G of n vertices, We can represent the graph by the adjacent matrix, where if there is an edge from vertex vi to vertex vj we have Gij = 1, otherwise, we set Gij = 0. We define a transition matrix M, where Mij is the transition probability of jumping from vertex vi to vertex vj. Because the probability sums to 1, we need to normalize M so that each row of M sums to 1.

Yes, that is a common mathematical formulation of a graph and its transition matrix. By representing the graph in this way, we can use linear algebra and matrix operations to analyze the graph and its properties. The transition matrix allows us to model the probability of moving from one vertex to another in a random walk on the graph. Normalizing the transition matrix so that each row sums to 1 ensures that the probabilities of transitioning to all possible next vertices add up to 1. This is necessary for the matrix to represent a valid probability distribution, which is essential for analyzing the properties of the graph using linear algebra and probability theory. Once we have the transition matrix, we can use it to compute various properties of the graph, such as the stationary distribution, which is the probability distribution of being at each vertex in the long run. We can also use the matrix to simulate random walks on the graph and study their behavior, such as how long it takes for the random walker to reach a certain vertex or how likely it is to get stuck in a particular part of the graph.

Here M is the transition matrix, X is the probability of the agent being on each vertex, which may stand for the ranks. Then the problem of figuring out the rank of each vertex can be broken down mathematically into the following equation: M.X = X
