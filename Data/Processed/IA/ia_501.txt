I am feeling a little tired and overwhelmed by the amount of work I have to keep track of. My company does conversational AI and recently we have spinned of parte of our attention from Alexa voice bots, to try and sell solutions based on OpenAI models. It is being hard to keep up with so many news and hype. I am not an organized person and It is difficult for me to create a system to keep track of things for me. Would you help me do that?

Of course, I'd be happy to help you create a system to better manage your workload and alleviate some of the overwhelm you are feeling. Before we dive into that, can you tell me a bit more about your work schedule and how you currently prioritize your tasks? This will help me get a better understanding of your current approach and what areas we can work on improving.

sure, I work from home as I am the owner of my own company. I have about 5 employees that work from home too. I really don't have a fixed hour to work from home as I always have too many activities that I do during the day like taking my kids to school, doing exercises, etc.  I generally prioritize activities by what's most critical for our commercial success as a company, but I also do a little tech work sometimes. Here's my typical week times I use for work. Monday through Friday 9:00 to 12:40 13:00 to 14:00 15:00 to 18:30 19:00 to 20:00
