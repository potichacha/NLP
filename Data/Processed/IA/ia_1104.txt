Why gitlab pipeline is getting stuck and it's taking more than 10 minutes instead of taking 20 sec.

There could be many reasons why a GitLab pipeline is taking longer than expected to execute. Here are some common reasons that can cause a pipeline to get stuck: Resource limitations: The pipeline may be competing for resources with other pipelines or jobs running on the same machine. This can cause the pipeline to slow down or even get stuck. Complexity of the pipeline: The pipeline may be running many jobs or stages, which can cause it to take longer to execute. Additionally, if the pipeline involves complex build or test scripts, it may take longer to complete. Network or connectivity issues: The pipeline may be running on a remote server or in the cloud, and network or connectivity issues can cause delays or timeouts. GitLab server or infrastructure issues: GitLab may be experiencing issues with its servers or infrastructure, which can cause pipelines to get stuck or fail. To troubleshoot the issue, you can start by checking the logs and status of each job in the pipeline to see where the pipeline is getting stuck. You can also review the pipeline configuration to see if there are any areas that could be optimized for performance. Additionally, you may want to check the system status of GitLab to see if there are any known issues or outages that could be affecting the pipeline.

We have used gitlab pipeline for deploying code on S3. But it taking more than 10 minutes instead of taking 20 sec.
