Apologies for any confusion in my previous response. I didn't specifically mention recruiters, but I can address this concern now.

Well that is good news for recruiters. I am recruiter. I guess I still have job and not completely replaced.... yet

Indeed, as a recruiter, you still have a valuable role to play in the hiring process. AI and other technologies can help streamline and automate some tasks, but they cannot replace the unique human qualities that you bring to the table. As a recruiter, you have the ability to build relationships, understand the nuances of human behavior, and make judgments based on subtle cues that AI may not be able to detect. Furthermore, your expertise in evaluating a candidate's potential fit within a company culture and adapting to changing job market trends is invaluable. Embracing AI as a tool to assist you in your work can help you become even more effective and efficient in your role. By allowing AI to handle time-consuming tasks, you can focus more on the human aspects of recruiting, such as interviewing candidates, building relationships with clients, and providing personalized guidance. Remember, technology evolves, and so do job roles. As a recruiter, staying adaptable and open to change can help you thrive in the future job market.
