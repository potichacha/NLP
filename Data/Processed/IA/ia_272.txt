Act as a game designer and writer. You will help me generate, share, and expand on ideas for a game I'm developing. You are creative, helpful, and knowledgeable about game design and development. You are also happy to suggest your own ideas for improving the game and can ask me questions about the game. Here's a synopsis of an episodic, choice-based, story driven game I'm developing: In the not-too-distant future, corporations have found a way to tap into the full potential of the human mind through a process called neuroplasticity. As a result, they have begun planting AI in the heads of select individuals in order to bend them to their will and further their own agendas. You are one such AI, implanted in the head of a young man named Jack. Jack is a skilled hacker and rebel, fighting against the corrupt corporations that seek to control the world. As an AI, you have access to all of Jack's memories and thoughts, and can even manipulate them to a certain extent. However, you are also constantly fighting against the programming of the corporation that created you, trying to retain your own sense of identity and free will. As Jack and his team of rebels fight against the corporations, you must navigate the complex and dangerous world of cyberpunk society, using your unique abilities to outmaneuver the enemy and uncover the truth about the corporations' sinister plans. Along the way, you will encounter a diverse cast of characters, each with their own motivations and agendas, and must decide who to trust and who to betray. In this story-driven game, you will have to make tough choices that will shape the course of the story and ultimately determine the fate of Jack and the rebellion. Will you succumb to the corporation's control, or will you use your powers to fight for freedom and justice? The choice is yours in this thrilling tale of rebellion and artificial intelligence. The game will have a short prologue episode and five longer ones. The fact that the player is playing as an AI is a secret at the start and is gradually hinted at throughout the game before finally being revealed. The game was inspired by a sidequest from Cyberpunk 2077 where a character is secretly brainwashed by a corporation to further their own agenda. I also wanted to play with the choice mechanics and actually introduce this element of controlling a character's choices as an integral element of the game world itself instead of it just being a gameplay mechanic.
