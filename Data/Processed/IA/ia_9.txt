Explain wifi channel interference

Wi-Fi channel interference occurs when two or more Wi-Fi devices are using the same or overlapping channels in the same location, causing conflicts and reduced performance. This can happen when multiple devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network or when devices on different networks are operating in close proximity to each other. There are a total of 14 channels available for Wi-Fi devices to use in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, which is the most commonly used frequency band for Wi-Fi. However, only three non-overlapping channels (1, 6, and 11) are available for use in the United States and Canada, which means that if multiple devices are using the same channel, they will interfere with each other. To minimize interference, it is best to use a channel that is not being used by other nearby Wi-Fi networks. This can be done using a Wi-Fi scanner tool, which can scan for nearby networks and show which channels they are using. You can then select a channel that is not being used by other networks to minimize interference. It is also important to keep in mind that other devices in your home or office, such as cordless phones and baby monitors, can also cause interference on the same frequency band as Wi-Fi.
