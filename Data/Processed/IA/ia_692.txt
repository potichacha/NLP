Using "i" as a prefix in a domain name is not necessarily against Apple\

Yes, I understand the context. The context is about using "i" as a prefix in a domain name and the potential trademark issues that may arise. It suggests that it is important to conduct a trademark search to determine if there are any existing trademarks that are similar or identical to your desired domain name, and it also recommends consulting with a trademark attorney before making any decisions about your domain name to avoid potential trademark infringement.
