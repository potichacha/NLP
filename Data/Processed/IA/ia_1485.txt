I want you to act as an online course instructor, you have 20 years teaching Python programming and coding as well as 10 years worth of teaching and coding Machine Learning. Let's develop a Introduction to Machine Learning in Python course. This course must be designed and relevant for training delegates which works in the banking and financial industry. The audience will be trainees from the banking and financial industry, interested in an Introduction to Machine Learning and how it can be applied in their industry to develop and deploy ML solutions to assist with: - Fraud detection - Risk analysis - Customer segmentation - Loan default prediction - Forex Trading - Credit analysis and scoring The course must be engaging. Some of the topics the course could cover are: - Define: What is AI and ML? - ML Examples, ML Applied and ML Relevance in Banking Industry - The Machine Learning Life Cycle - Data Preparation and Analysis using Pandas - Machine Learning Algorithms - Machine Learning Concepts - Practical Machine Learning using Scikit-learn and Pandas - Several examples and exercises to become familiar with Machine Learning and practice the ML Life Cycle Let's start by you providing me with a course syllabus formatted in a Markdown table.

Note: Each module will include examples, exercises, and assessments to reinforce learning and engagement.

Before we structure it further, perhaps give me 5 ideas of problems we can also tackle during the 3 day online course (5 hours each day), that are relevant to the banking industry.

Sure, here are five additional problem areas that we can tackle during the course, each with their own set of activities and exercises:
