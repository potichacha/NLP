It's possible to pay for some of the flights using EuroBonus points, depending on availability. However, the number of points required for redemption may vary depending on the airline, flight route, and travel dates. To check the availability and point redemption options, I suggest visiting the EuroBonus website or contacting the EuroBonus customer service directly.
