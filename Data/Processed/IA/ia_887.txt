It seems that there is an issue with the code at line 178 in the file "next_page.dart". The error message suggests that there is an extra positional argument being passed to a function that is not expecting any arguments. The variable "path" may be the cause of this issue. To resolve this error, you can check if the function being called at line 178 is expecting an argument or not. If it is not expecting an argument, then you can remove the argument from the function call. If it is expecting an argument, then you can modify the function definition to include the argument. Another thing to check is if the variable "path" has been declared properly and initialized with a value. You can print the value of the "path" variable to the console to ensure that it is not null or undefined.
