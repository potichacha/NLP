I have a MongoDB local server. How to get a collection's items to a long list in html? I want the list to be updated

To retrieve data from a MongoDB collection and display it as a list in HTML, you will need to use a server-side programming language such as Node.js and a templating engine like EJS or Handlebars. Here's an example using Node.js and EJS: This will render a simple HTML page with an unordered list of items retrieved from the MongoDB collection. The list will be updated each time the page is refreshed. Note that this is just a basic example and you will need to modify it to suit your specific needs. For example, you may want to add more fields to the items in the collection or implement pagination if the collection is very large.
