Is there a librosa  method to detect sound window in a audio file

Yes, Librosa provides several methods to detect sound events or segments in an audio file. One commonly used approach is to use onset detection methods to locate the start times of sound events. The  librosa.onset.onset_detect  function can be used to detect onsets in an audio signal. It takes the audio signal and sampling rate as input and returns an array of time stamps corresponding to the detected onsets. For example: This will output an array of onset times in seconds. You can then use these onset times to extract sound windows or segments from the original audio file using the  librosa.util.frame  function. For example: This will output the shape of the onset windows array, which should be (window_size, num_onsets).

How can i detect the lenght of every sound event

To detect the length of each sound event, you can use the onset times detected using  librosa.onset.onset_detect  function as the starting points and the ending points of each sound event can be detected using the  librosa.effects.trim  function. The  librosa.effects.trim  function takes the audio signal and a tolerance parameter as input and returns the trimmed audio signal and the index range of the trimmed audio. You can use the onset times and the trimmed audio signal index range to determine the length of each sound event. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to detect the length of each sound event: This code will print out a list of lengths of each sound event detected in the audio file, in seconds.
