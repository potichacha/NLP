Hello It is my understanding that Promise.any(p1, p2, p3) returns the first fulfilled promise. If p1 is fulfilled first then it returns the p1 promise. However - despite p2 and p3 not being first they continue to run. Is there a method that would cancel p2 and p3? something like Promise.getFirstFulfilledThenCancelTheRest(p1, p2, p3) thoughts? thanks

Yes, you are correct that  Promise.any  returns the first fulfilled promise and doesn't cancel the other promises. If you want to cancel the remaining promises once one of them has been fulfilled, you can use the  AbortController  API. Here's an example implementation of a  getFirstFulfilledThenCancelTheRest  function that uses  AbortController : This function creates an  AbortController  and its associated  signal , which will be used to abort the remaining promises. Then it creates a new array of promises that includes a promise that resolves when the  signal  is aborted. This is necessary because once a promise has settled (fulfilled or rejected), it cannot be cancelled. Finally, the function returns a new promise that resolves with the value of the first fulfilled promise or rejects with an error if all promises are rejected or the  signal  is aborted. If the promise resolves, the function aborts the remaining promises using the  AbortController . You can use this function as follows: In this example,  p1  is immediately fulfilled, so the function returns  1  and aborts  p2  and  p3 . If  p1  were rejected, the function would wait for  p2  and  p3  to settle and return an error. If  p2  were fulfilled before  p1 , the function would return  2  and abort  p1  and  p3 . If  p3  were fulfilled before  p1  or  p2 , the function would return  3  and abort  p1  and  p2 .
