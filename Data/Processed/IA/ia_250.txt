{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Hi GPT. As initial conditions I have that , the blue block is clear , the yellow block is clear , the magenta block is clear , the black block is clear , the cyan block is clear , the green block is clear , the violet block is clear , the gold block is clear , the hand is empty , the blue block is on the table , the yellow block is on the table , the magenta block is on the table , the black block is on the table , the cyan block is on the table , the green block is on the table , the violet block is on the table and the gold block is on the table. My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the cyan block , the yellow block is on top of the blue block , the magenta block is on top of the green block , the black block is on top of the yellow block , the cyan block is on top of the gold block , the green block is on top of the black block and the violet block is on top of the magenta block. Here is the ground-truth domain: (define (domain block-world)  (:requirements :strips :equality :typing)  (:types  block hand  )  (:predicates  (on ?x ?y) ; x is on top of y  (on-table ?x); x is on top of table  (clear ?x) ; x has nothing on top of it  (empty ?x) ; x has nothing  (holding ?x) ; robot is holding x  )  (:action pick-up  :parameters (?b - block)  :precondition (and (clear ?b) (on-table ?b) (empty hand))  :effect (and (not (clear ?b)) (not (on-table ?b)) (not (empty hand))  (holding ?b)  (increase (total-cost) 1)  ))    (:action put-down  :parameters (?b - block)  :precondition (and (holding ?b))  :effect (and (clear ?b) (on-table ?b) (not (holding ?b)) (empty hand)  (increase (total-cost) 1)  ))    (:action stack  :parameters (?b1 - block ?b2 - block)  :precondition (and (holding ?b1) (clear ?b2))  :effect (and (not (holding ?b1)) (not (clear ?b2)) (empty hand)  (on ?b1 ?b2) (clear ?b1)  (increase (total-cost) 1)  ))    (:action unstack  :parameters (?b1 - block ?b2 - block)  :precondition (and (on ?b1 ?b2) (clear ?b1) (empty hand))  :effect (and (holding ?b1) (clear ?b2) (not (on ?b1 ?b2)) (not (empty hand))  (increase (total-cost) 1)  )) ) And here is the problem pddl file: (define (problem block-world)  (:domain block-world)  (:objects  blue yellow magenta black cyan green violet gold - block  hand - hand)    (:init  (clear blue) (clear yellow) (clear magenta) (clear black) (clear cyan)  (clear green) (clear violet) (clear gold) (empty hand)  (on-table blue) (on-table yellow) (on-table magenta) (on-table black)  (on-table cyan) (on-table green) (on-table violet) (on-table gold))    (:goal  (and  (on blue cyan) (on yellow blue) (on magenta green) (on black yellow)  (on cyan gold) (on green black) (on violet magenta)))    (:metric minimize (total-cost)) ) Now, I have a new problem. As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the black block is clear, the cyan block is clear, the green block is clear, the violet block is clear, the silver block is clear, the hand is
