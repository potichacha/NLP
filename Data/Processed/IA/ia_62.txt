Prepare a report on the application of electromechnical energy conversion principles in a medical areas or their application in a biomedical engineering (not- less than a page, notmore than two pages) Mention MRI Machine in your reportElectromechanical energy conversion principles are applied in a wide range of medical and biomedical engineering applications, from diagnostic imaging and therapy to prosthetics and rehabilitation. One of the most widely used and well-known examples of this application is in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines.MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of internal body structures. It is used in many medical applications, including the diagnosis of diseases and injuries of the brain and spine, as well as the detection of cancer, heart disease, and other conditions.The basic principle behind MRI is the application of a large magnetic field to the body, which aligns the nuclei of hydrogen atoms present in the body. When radio waves are emitted at the body, these nuclei absorb the energy and emit a radio frequency signal. This signal is then received by a detector and used to construct an image of the body\
