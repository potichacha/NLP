Are you familiar with professor Antonio Ortega?

I am familiar with a professor named Antonio Ortega, but I don't have enough information to determine if this is the same person you are asking about. Antonio Ortega is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Southern California, who has made significant contributions in the field of signal processing and communications. He is the director of the Signal and Image Processing Institute (SIPI) and has a number of publications, patents and awards in his name. If you could provide me with more information about the specific Antonio Ortega you are asking about, I would be happy to provide more information.

I am indeed talking about that Antonio Ortega. He has been asked by Amazon to apply the ideas in his work to the field of Natural Language Processing. How would you suggest he approach that? He is having trouble finding what could be relevant to the field and how he could use his previous work.
