What is a support letter?

A support letter is a document that expresses support, endorsement, or recommendation for a particular person, organization, project, or initiative. It is usually written by someone who has a positive relationship with the recipient and who can provide insights into the recipient's character, skills, and accomplishments. Support letters are often requested in various contexts, such as job applications, college admissions, grant applications, visa applications, or legal proceedings. They can also be used to support a friend or family member who is going through a difficult time. In general, a support letter should provide specific examples of the recipient's strengths, achievements, and contributions. It should also explain how the recipient's work or actions have benefited others, and why the author believes that the recipient deserves support or recognition. The tone of the letter should be professional and sincere, and it should be written in a clear and concise manner.
