Today I want to work with you on the first chapter, which I called MECHANISMS OF MEMORY AND THE ROLE OF DIETARY MINERAL COMPOSITION AMONG THE FACTORS AFFECTING IT. The first chapter will be dedicated to the literature review, which will systematically outline the state of the researched issues. This chapter will consist of five parts (1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 and 1.5). Here is the plan for my first chapter: CHAPTER 1 MECHANISMS OF MEMORY AND THE ROLE OF THE MINERAL COMPOSITION OF THE DIET AMONG THE FACTORS AFFECTING IT 1.1 Cognitive disorders are an important medical and social problem 1.2 Memory, its phases and their mechanisms 1.3 Influence of the state of mineral metabolism on memory 1.4 The state of the mineral composition of the diet in the nutrition of modern humanity 1.5 The current state of research on the influence of the mineral composition of the diet on the functional state of the central nervous system and the effects of psychotropic drugs. We worked with you and now we have the first part of the first chapter complete. I\'ll send you the whole text of it in my next message and you will read it and check it for any inconsistencies, errors or mistakes and provide me with the results of your evaluation, ok?'}
