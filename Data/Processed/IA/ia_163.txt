Explain how to use partitioning to build large data dictionary when compressing binary strings

Partitioning is a technique used to divide a large data set into smaller, more manageable parts. When building a large data dictionary for compressing binary strings, partitioning can be used to reduce the size of the dictionary, making it easier to store and manage. The process of using partitioning in this scenario can be broken down into the following steps: Divide the binary strings into smaller substrings: The first step is to divide the binary strings into smaller substrings of a fixed length. This length should be chosen based on the desired size of the final data dictionary. Create a frequency table for each substring: Next, create a frequency table for each substring. This frequency table will be used to determine which substrings are most frequently occurring and should be included in the data dictionary. Build the data dictionary: Using the frequency table, select the most frequently occurring substrings and build the data dictionary. This can be done by assigning a unique code to each substring in the dictionary. Compress the binary strings using the data dictionary: Finally, use the data dictionary to compress the binary strings by replacing each substring in the binary string with its corresponding code. By using partitioning in this way, you can build a large data dictionary for compressing binary strings that is optimized for size and efficiency.

And

what if I want to decompress the binary strings later? To decompress the binary strings, you need to have a reverse mapping of the code to the corresponding substring in the data dictionary. During compression, this reverse mapping can be created and stored along with the compressed binary strings. During decompression, the compressed binary strings are processed and the codes are replaced with the corresponding substrings using the reverse mapping. This process is repeated until the original binary strings are reconstructed. By having the reverse mapping, you can ensure that the decompression process is accurate and efficient.
