What is a "system"?

A "system" is a general term that refers to a set of interconnected components or elements that work together to form a coherent and organized whole. These components can be physical objects, abstract concepts, or a combination of both. The purpose of a system is typically to achieve a specific goal, solve a problem, or maintain a certain state of balance. Systems can be found in various contexts, such as natural systems (e.g., ecosystems, solar systems), technical systems (e.g., computer systems, transportation systems), and social systems (e.g., economic systems, political systems). They can be simple or complex, depending on the number and nature of the components involved and the relationships between them.

I'm writing a post about the concept of universality. Can you explain what universality is? I'm aware there are some different definitions - please list them all
