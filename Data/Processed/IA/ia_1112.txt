Here's the code modified to import the 'diff' module correctly and to display the output using the 'chalk' package for colors: Before running this code, make sure to install the 'chalk' package if you haven't already: Now, when you run this script, you will see the differences between the two strings in the console, with additions highlighted in green, deletions in red, and common parts in grey.

Assess the performance of the above nodeJs code and provide optimization suggestions. Current scenario is above code took 3 seconds to give the result and we want to optimize it to get result in as minimum time as possible.  Please suggest optimization.

The given code doesn't seem to be computationally intensive, so it's surprising that it takes 3 seconds to run. However, to help you optimize the code, here are some suggestions: If the granularity of the differences on a word or line level is sufficient for your use case, consider using  Diff.diffWords  or  Diff.diffLines  instead of  Diff.diffChars . These functions can be faster since they have fewer iterations. or To pinpoint where the code is taking the most time, you can use  console.time  and  console.timeEnd  to measure the time taken for each part of the code. This will help you identify potential bottlenecks. For example: If the output generation is the bottleneck, you can try to optimize string concatenation by using an array and the  join  function, rather than concatenating strings directly.

You suggested this change "Use diffWords or diffLines instead of diffChars" but in the given scenario of DhiWise it\

I understand that detecting character-level differences is important for your use case. In that case, you can stick to using  diffChars . However, you can still follow the other optimization suggestions mentioned earlier. However, since character-level differences can be more computationally intensive, optimizing the code further might not have a significant impact on the overall performance. The 'diff' library itself is already optimized for character comparisons. If you still face performance issues, you may want to consider the following: Check for issues in the environment where the code is being executed. Make sure there are no other resource-intensive tasks running in parallel, and that there's sufficient memory available for the script. If the input strings are extremely large, you could potentially break them down into smaller chunks
