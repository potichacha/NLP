Hi there! Can you write a python script that will read a VTT caption file, identify any gaps larger than 2.5 seconds between caption frames, then using the end and start times create another VTT caption file?

Yes, I can help you write a Python script to read a VTT caption file, identify any gaps larger than 2.5 seconds between caption frames, and then create another VTT caption file using the end and start times. Here is an example script that should accomplish what you're looking for: This script should read in the contents of the input VTT file, parse the timestamps for each caption frame, identify any gaps larger than 2.5 seconds between frames, and insert a blank line with the missing time in the new VTT file. It will then write the new VTT file to the output file specified. Note that this script assumes that the input VTT file has the same format as a standard VTT caption file, with timestamps in the format  HH:MM:SS.MS --> HH:MM:SS.MS  and caption text following each timestamp. If your VTT file has a different format, you may need to modify the regular expressions used in the script to match your file's format.

Thank you. I will be running this on a windows machine. Can you update accordingly?

Yes, I can update the script for running on a Windows machine. Here's the updated script: The main changes are: This updated script should work on Windows machines.

Thank you. Will I need to put this script in the same folder as the input.vtt?

Yes, you should place the script in the same folder as the input VTT file for the script to work correctly. Alternatively, you can modify the script to accept the file paths for the input and output files as command-line arguments. This way, you can run the script from any location on your machine. Here's an example of how to modify the script to accept command-line arguments: With this modified script, you can run the script from the command line using the following command: Where  input.vtt  is the path to the input file and  output.vtt  is the path to the output file. This way, you can run the script from any location on your machine, as long as you provide the correct file paths.
