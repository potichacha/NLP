Of course, I'd be happy to help you write a reference check report for your former team member. Please provide the list of questions Dasra has sent you and a brief overview of her performance. Once I have that information, I can help you articulate your thoughts and create a well-crafted reference report that highlights her strengths and skills.

1. Can you describe your relationship with the candidate? 2. How you would describe his/her strengths? 3. What are some areas of improvement? 4. Can you describe a time when he/she had to deal with shifting priorities? 5. What work conditions does the candidate thrive in? 6. What advice would you have for their future manager to bring out the best in them? 7. Has this person ever gone through a disciplinary procedure in your organization?Share Prompt

Thank you for providing the questions. Please give me a brief overview of her performance and any specific instances or qualities you'd like me to include in the answers. This will help me craft a well-rounded reference check report that accurately reflects your thoughts about her.
