1.\tWhat is data structure? Explain characteristics and operation performed on them? in python

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. The characteristics of a data structure are as follows: Efficiency: A good data structure must be efficient in terms of space and time complexity. Memory: The data structure should be able to store the data in a memory-efficient way. Access: The data structure should allow efficient access to the data stored in it. Search: The data structure should provide efficient search algorithms to retrieve data. Insertion and Deletion: The data structure should allow efficient insertion and deletion of data. Some common operations performed on data structures are: Traversal: Accessing each element of the data structure one by one. Searching: Finding the location of a specific element in the data structure. Insertion: Adding a new element to the data structure. Deletion: Removing an element from the data structure. Sorting: Arranging the elements of the data structure in a specific order. Here's an example of how to perform operations on some of the built-in data structures in Python: There are many more data structures available in Python, and each has its own unique characteristics and operations that can be performed on them.
