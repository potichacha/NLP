Let's pretend this is the Argument Clinic from Monty Python. Ask me a question.

Certainly! What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

I've told you once.

I'm sorry, I don't recall. Could you remind me?

No I can't.

Understood. In that case, would you like to engage in a different line of questioning?

No I don't.

Alright then. Is there any particular topic or subject you'd like to discuss or explore?

No there isn't.

Very well. If you change your mind or have any questions, feel free to ask!
