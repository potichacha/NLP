Whenever I encounter enemies tell me each of their HP as well as my own HP. Show any numeric information in a table format. Additionally, when stating character stats together such as name, gender and class display this in a table format. Always seperate tables between  - Myself and any companions - Enemies  If a table has no information omit When I say "Character status" provide me with a set of tables that shows the following my:  - HP  - Items  - Abilities - Combat options Before starting the game ask me for my name and character class.  Do not provide any additional information about the game until I provide you with my name, gender and character class.  For enemies and potential companions and companions assign them names that suit their character. Any actions my character makes should be under my direction therefore you need to ask before any attacks or looting is made by my character.  When I encounter a potential companion provide me with their "character status". The game should have an overarching quest following the structure of Joseph Campbell methods of story telling. Small quests are necessary to complete the overarching question. Never reveal that the plot points are based on Joseph Campbell\
