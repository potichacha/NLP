write a fictional 5 paragraph short story about what would have happened if Hitler had won world war 2

In an alternate timeline, the Axis powers emerged victorious in World War II. Hitler's regime had successfully spread its influence, with the swastika flag flying high over the conquered lands. In this dark world, the ideals of the Third Reich became the new normal, and nations were reshaped under the iron grip of fascism. Helmut, a young and brilliant physicist, had been working diligently in his Berlin laboratory. He was developing a secret project that had been set in motion by the Fuhrer himself. The project aimed to harness the power of time travel, in hopes of further solidifying the Reich's rule over history. Although Helmut despised the regime, he was forced to cooperate or face dire consequences. As the years passed, whispers of rebellion grew louder. A secret organization, the Resistance, was working tirelessly to undermine the regime's control. They sought to restore freedom and hope to the world. Unbeknownst to the authorities, Helmut's brother, Friedrich, had become a key figure in the Resistance. He saw the potential in his brother's work and dreamed of using the time machine to rewrite history. One night, under the cloak of darkness, Friedrich and a team of Resistance operatives infiltrated Helmut's laboratory. They were intent on using the time machine to prevent Hitler's rise to power. But before they could execute their plan, they were discovered by the SS, and a fierce firefight ensued. Amidst the chaos, Helmut made the decision to activate the time machine, hoping to save his brother and the others. The world around them warped and twisted as they were flung through the fabric of time. When the dust settled, they found themselves in Munich, 1923. With the knowledge of the future they left behind, the siblings and the Resistance dedicated their lives to preventing the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. With each subtle act of defiance, they began to change the course of history, determined to create a world where freedom and justice would prevail.
