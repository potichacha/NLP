How does one embroider a French Knot?

Embroidering a French Knot is a simple technique that can add dimension and texture to your embroidery projects. Here are the steps to embroider a French Knot: Thread your needle with embroidery floss. It is recommended to use a single strand of floss for French Knots to ensure that the knot is not too bulky. Bring the needle up through the fabric where you want to create the knot. Hold the needle in your non-dominant hand, with the thread loosely draped over your fingers. Use your dominant hand to wrap the thread twice around the needle, starting at the base of the needle and moving towards the tip. Hold the wraps in place with your non-dominant hand, while using your dominant hand to insert the needle back into the fabric close to where it came up. Pull the needle all the way through the fabric while holding the wraps taut with your non-dominant hand. This will create a small knot on the surface of the fabric. Gently tug on the floss to tighten the knot, and then release the wraps with your non-dominant hand. Repeat the process for each knot, spacing them out as desired. Note: If you want a larger knot, you can wrap the thread around the needle more than twice. However, be careful not to wrap it too many times, as this will create a bulky knot that may distort the fabric.
