how to setuo openvino on rpi4 8GB to make model use GPU for inference?

To set up OpenVINO on Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) to make the model use GPU for inference, you can follow these steps: Install the OpenVINO toolkit on your Raspberry Pi 4. You can follow the official installation guide from Intel:  Download the OpenVINO model optimizer and IR library for Raspberry Pi 4 from the OpenVINO website:  Convert your trained model to the Intermediate Representation (IR) format using the OpenVINO model optimizer. The IR format is required for the model to run on the Raspberry Pi 4 with the OpenVINO inference engine. Load the optimized model onto the Raspberry Pi 4 and use the OpenVINO inference engine to run inference on the model. To use the GPU for inference, you need to set the  DEVICE  environment variable to  GPU . Here is an example command to run the inference engine using the GPU: This will run the object detection demo using the optimized model and the GPU for inference on the Raspberry Pi 4. Note: To use the GPU for inference on Raspberry Pi 4, you need to have a compatible GPU driver installed. You can check the compatibility and installation instructions in the OpenVINO documentation.
