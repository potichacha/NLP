what is hybrid lattice design

Hybrid lattice design is a type of engineering design that combines the benefits of both lattice structures and solid structures. In a lattice structure, the object is composed of a network of interconnected struts or beams, which provides strength while reducing the amount of material used. In contrast, a solid structure is made of a continuous material with no empty spaces, which provides greater stability but may be heavier and use more material. Hybrid lattice design aims to create structures that leverage the benefits of both types of structures. This is achieved by combining solid and lattice structures in a way that optimizes the benefits of each. For example, a hybrid lattice design may use a solid core surrounded by a lattice structure, or a lattice structure with solid beams at key stress points. The advantages of hybrid lattice design include reduced weight, improved strength, and increased stability. It is often used in the design of buildings, bridges, and other large structures where both strength and weight are important factors.

The nuanced response of practical lattice systems, whereby the local stresses and observed deformation are a function of both the Maxwell number and the associated loading type (Section 5.1.2), enables the design team to make informed and robust engineering design decisions in response to the technical requirements of the AM design project. This insight enables, for example, the specification of functional AM lattice structures that include under-stiff elements to avoid inducing excessive forces in response to the initial displace- ment and include over-stiff elements to avoid undue deflection
