I am designing a vessel and referring to the PED for compliance purposes. The maximum allowable pressure of my equipment is greater than 0.5 bar and it is included in Article 1.2. What steps do I need to take?

If the maximum allowable pressure of your equipment is greater than 0.5 bar and it is included in Article 1.2 of the PED, then you will need to ensure that the design, manufacture, and testing of your vessel comply with the requirements of the PED. This may include performing a risk assessment, preparing a technical file, and having the vessel inspected and tested by a notified body. You should also ensure that the vessel is marked with the CE symbol and that it is accompanied by a Declaration of Conformity. It's recommended to consult the PED and consult with a professional to ensure compliance.
