{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To load an NgModule into its own bundle in Angular, you can use the Angular CLI to generate a lazy-loaded module and a corresponding routing module. This will allow you to load the module and its associated components asynchronously when the user navigates to a specified route. Here is an example of how to do this using the Angular CLI: This will create a new module file ( my-lazy-module.module.ts ) and a corresponding routing module ( my-lazy-module-routing.module.ts ). Define the routes for the lazy-loaded module in the routing module. For example: Now, when the user navigates to the  /my-lazy-module  route, the  MyLazyModuleModule  and its associated components will be loaded asynchronously. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.'}
