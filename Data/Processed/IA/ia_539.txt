how to PX4 booting sequence realtime view

The PX4 booting sequence is a complex process that involves multiple components and subsystems. However, you can view the booting sequence in real-time by following these steps: Connect to the PX4 flight controller via a serial console or a USB cable. You can use a terminal emulator application like PuTTY or minicom to establish a serial connection with the flight controller. Power on the flight controller and observe the console output. You should see the booting sequence messages starting to appear on the console. The booting sequence typically starts with the bootloader, which initializes the hardware and loads the firmware. You should see messages indicating that the bootloader is running and detecting the hardware. Once the bootloader has loaded the firmware, the PX4 firmware starts running. You should see messages indicating that the firmware is initializing the sensors, the actuators, and other subsystems. As the firmware initializes each subsystem, you should see messages indicating the progress and any errors or warnings that may occur. The console output can give you a good indication of the health of the system. Once the PX4 firmware has completed its initialization sequence, it will start running the flight stack and entering the normal operating mode. Overall, the booting sequence of PX4 can be quite fast, so you may need to pay close attention to the console output to catch all the messages. Additionally, if you encounter any errors or problems during the booting sequence, the console output can provide valuable information for troubleshooting.
