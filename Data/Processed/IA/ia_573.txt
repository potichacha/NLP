{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Model: Default (GPT-3.5)2 / 2i want a gui form editor easy as delphi 7 but for python and it should be free for commercial use. and it should work in windows1 / 1There are several GUI form editors available for Python that are easy to use and free for commercial use. One such editor that you can use is PyQt Designer, which is part of the PyQt package.PyQt is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework and it is a popular choice for developing GUI applications in Python. PyQt Designer is a graphical user interface (GUI) design tool that allows you to create dialogs, widgets, and main windows visually. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for adding components, and you can easily arrange them to create the layout you want.To get started with PyQt Designer, you need to first install PyQt on your system. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal window:Copy codepip install PyQt5 Once you have installed PyQt, you can launch PyQt Designer by running the following command in a terminal window:Copy codedesigner This will launch the PyQt Designer application, and you can start designing your GUI by dragging and dropping components from the toolbox onto the form. PyQt Designer also allows you to preview your GUI as you design it, so you can see how it will look when you run your Python code.When you are done designing your GUI, you can save the form as a .ui file, which is an XML-based file format that describes the layout of your GUI. You can then use the pyuic5 tool (also included with PyQt) to convert the .ui file into a Python module that you can use in your code. For example, if your .ui file is named "myform.ui", you can generate the corresponding Python module by running the following command in a terminal window:Copy codepyuic5 -o myform.py myform.ui This will generate a Python module named "myform.py" that contains the code for your GUI.Overall, PyQt Designer is a powerful and easy-to-use GUI form editor for Python that is free for commercial use and works on Windows.1 / 1"designer" не является внутренней или внешней командой, исполняемой программой или пакетным файлом.1 / 1I apologize for the confusion. The "designer" command I mentioned is specific to Unix-based systems, such as Linux or macOS. If you are using Windows, you can launch PyQt Designer from the Start menu by searching for "Qt Designer" or "PyQt Designer" (depending on how PyQt was installed on your system).Alternatively, you can launch PyQt Designer from the command prompt by running the following command:Copy codepyqt5-tools designer This will launch PyQt Designer on your Windows system. Once you have launched the application, you can follow the steps I outlined earlier to create your GUI forms.1 / 1"pyqt5-tools" не является внутренней или внешней командой, исполняемой программой или пакетным файлом.1 / 1I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The command "pyqt5-tools" is used on Linux systems and ma
