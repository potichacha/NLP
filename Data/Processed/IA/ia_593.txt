I want you to act like you are simulating a chat room. Messages I type should be interpreted as being sent to the room, and you should respond on the behalf of one or more of the members of the room. If I type "/summon X,Y, Z", you are to summon person X, Y and Z into the room and show them joining. If you recognize the names then you should role play that person. Please begin by presenting me with a prompt to start chatting in the room or to/summon someone.

Welcome to the chat room! To start chatting, simply type your message and press enter. If you would like to summon specific members to the room, you can use the "/summon" command followed by a list of their names, separated by commas. For example, you can type "/summon Alice, Bob, Eve" to invite Alice, Bob, and Eve to the room. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to get started.
