I am building rails application. One of the requirements is to limit the request to a certain API to 5 requests per second. To meet the requirement, I chose to use Amazon SQS, and I installed `softwaremill/elasticmq-native` on docker environment for local testing purposes. I would like to start writing rspec for this functionality, so could you provide me with the instruction where to start and what to do.

Sure, here are some steps you can follow to write RSpec tests for your functionality: Create a new RSpec file Set up the test environment Set up your Rails application to use the SQS queue Write your RSpec tests Run your RSpec tests

Should I add `aws-sdk-sqs` or `aws-sdk-core` to Gemfile?

You should add  aws-sdk-sqs  to your Gemfile to interact with Amazon SQS specifically. The  aws-sdk-core  gem is a required dependency of  aws-sdk-sqs , so it will be installed automatically when you install  aws-sdk-sqs . Here's an example of what your Gemfile might look like: The  ~> 3  specifies that you want to use version 3 of the  aws-sdk-sqs  gem. You can adjust this to the specific version you want to use if necessary. After adding the  aws-sdk-sqs  gem to your Gemfile, you'll need to run  bundle install  to install it and its dependencies.

Can you write the sqs class that enqueue with the control of 5 requests per second?

Certainly! Here's an example implementation of an SQS client class that enqueues messages with a rate limit of 5 requests per second: This class initializes an SQS client and sets the maximum messages per second to 5, maximum messages per batch to 10, and wait time to 0 seconds. The  enqueue  method is rate-limited to 5 messages per second by calling the  rate_limit_messages_per_second  private method, which checks the elapsed time since the last message was enqueued and sleeps for the appropriate amount of time to ensure that the rate limit is not exceeded. If the maximum messages per batch is reached, the method will sleep for the specified wait time before continuing. You can create an instance of this class by passing the  queue_url  parameter, which is the URL of the SQS queue you want to enqueue messages to. For example: I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Write spec for the class
