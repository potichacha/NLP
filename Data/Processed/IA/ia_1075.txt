Write me a shell script to scaffold out a Next.js and Turborepo project

Sure, here's a sample shell script that you can use to scaffold out a Next.js and Turborepo project: To use this script, copy and paste it into a new file, give it execute permissions ( chmod +x script.sh ), and then run it in your terminal ( ./script.sh ). This will prompt you to enter the name and path of your project, and then it will create a Turborepo workspace with a Next.js app in the  packages  directory. Finally, it will add the Turborepo package as a dependency and update the  next.config.js  file to use Turborepo's webpack configuration.
