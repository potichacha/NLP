{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'In dentistry, occlusion refers to the way the teeth meet when the lower and upper jaws come together. Group function is a type of occlusal scheme that is essential for esthetics, phonetics, and mastication, as well as the prevention of disease [ ]. Group function occlusion refers to the simultaneous contact of multiple teeth on both sides of the jaw during biting and chewing movements. In this scheme, the canine teeth do not provide guidance, but rather, the posterior teeth share the load during chewing [ ]. It is important to note that there is no scientific evidence that supports one occlusal scheme over the other, including group function and canine guidance occlusion [ ]. A 2016 study found that both group function and canine-guided occlusions are equally acceptable when restoring the dentition [ ]. Overall, group function occlusion is a type of occlusal scheme that involves the simultaneous contact of multiple posterior teeth during biting and chewing movements. While there is no evidence to support one scheme over the other, group function occlusion is an acceptable option when restoring the dentition.'}
