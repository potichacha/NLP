{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Consider a ‘‘Tower of Hanoi" problem with three rods A, B, C, and three disks 1, 2, 3. Disk 3 is larger than disk 2, the disk 2 is larger than disk 1. In the beginning, the disks are arranged to the rods. You need to move the disk properly to get to the goal arrangement.  An example of the state is: Rod A: [3,2,1] This means that Rod A has disk 3 on the bottom and disk 1 on the top. The rules are: Rule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time. Rule 2: Each move consists of taking the disk on the top of a rod off and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod. Rule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it. Initial state: ``` Rod A: [3,1] Rod B: [2] Rod C: [] ``` Goal state: ``` Rod A: [] Rod B: [] Rod C: [3,2,1] ``` Now you make an **optimal solution**. Let\'s think step by step. Stage 1: Plan. Start by listing out all valid moves at the current state. Action Items: - Repeat all the rules. - List out all valid moves. Example: = = = MOVE 1 STAGE 1 = = = - Rule Checking:  - Rule 1: Only one disk may be moved at a time.  - Rule 2: Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and placing it on top of another larger disk or on an empty rod.  - Rule 3: No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it. - Valid Moves:  - Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B  - Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C  - Move disk 2 from rod B to rod C Stage 2: Select. Each time, you **only select one move**. Give an explanation about why this move and print the state. Check if the representation correctly reflects the game state. If not, generate a new one. Action Items: - Choose a move. - Print the representation. - Check the representation Example: = = = MOVE 1 STAGE 2 = = = - Decision: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C - Next State:  ``` Rod A: [3] Rod B: [2] Rod C: [1] ``` Stage 3: Evaluate. After each move, make some evaluations. Action Items: - Repeat the goal condition. - Eval 1 (Value): Evaluate your move by rating it with a score of either -1, 0, or 1, and give an explanation. If the move violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. If you think the move is valid but not optimal, give a score of 0. Otherwise, give a score of 1. - Eval 2 (Short Horizon Reward): Evaluate how close is the state to the goal state by rating it with a score between 0 and 1, and give an explanation. If the state violates any of the rules, name the violated rule, and score the move as 0. Otherwise, it’s up to you to determine how close the state is to the goal state. - Eval 3 (Long Horizon Reward): Estimate the most likely Value and Short Horizon Reward for the next move, double check if the move will make it difficult to achieve the goal state in the long run, then rate it with a score between 0 and 1. Again, give an explanation.  - Eval 4 (Revised Value): Revise the Value based on the rewards. Example: = = = MOVE 1 STAGE 3 = = = - Goal Checking: ``` Rod A: [] Rod
