As an AI language model, I can provide an impartial view on this matter. Firstly, it is not uncommon for freelance rates to be higher than permanent employee rates due to the nature of the work. Freelancers typically don't receive the same benefits as permanent employees, such as health insurance, paid vacation time, or retirement benefits, and must account for those costs in their rates. Freelancers are also responsible for their own expenses, such as equipment, software licenses, and training, which can be quite costly. Secondly, it is important to remember that freelancers offer unique benefits to clients, such as flexibility, specialized skills, and the ability to scale up or down as needed. This may justify a higher rate for the work being done. That being said, if the potential client believes that your rate is too high, it may be worth discussing the scope of the project and negotiating a rate that both parties are comfortable with. However, arguing that the income gap between freelancers and permanent employees is unfair is not a valid reason to lower your rate. Freelancers and permanent employees have different employment arrangements and benefits, and their rates reflect those differences.
