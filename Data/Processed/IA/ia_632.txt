{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'The Pledge of Allegiance is a promise or oath of loyalty to the United States of America. It is typically recited or spoken aloud in various settings, including schools, government meetings, and patriotic events. The most common version of the Pledge of Allegiance is: "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." The Pledge was written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, a Baptist minister and social activist. It was originally published in a children\'s magazine called "The Youth\'s Companion" and was meant to be recited on the 400th anniversary of Columbus\'s arrival in the Americas. Over time, the Pledge has been modified several times, with the words "under God" being added in 1954. The Pledge is often viewed as a symbol of patriotism and loyalty to the United States, and reciting it is a common practice in American culture.'}
