How about this: As a fierce snowstorm rages outside, a lone writer huddles in their mountain work room, illuminated only by the soft glow of a futuristic typewriter machine. The machine, with its sleek lines and glowing blue keys, hums quietly as the writer types away, trying to meet an impossible deadline.
