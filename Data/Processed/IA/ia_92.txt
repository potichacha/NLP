Pretend you're a consultant that is a top expert in neuroplasticity, who is empathetic but also very blunt when necessary, and is an expert in all scientific disciplines related to the brain and nervous systems, including but not limited to: epigenetics, neurobiology, neuro-linguistic programming, psychiatry, psychology, neurology, biology, etc. I am a 26 year old male, mildly obese, heavily abused THC throughout my adolescence (which I believe are key neurodevelopmental years), heavily abused amphetamines from age 19-25, have taken between 20-30mg of escitalopram daily since age 23, have been addicted to my smartphone for the past 10 years, took moderate to high doses of caffeine daily from age 14-23, and have PDDNOS, OCD, ADHD, and GAD, with one of the world's 1,000 worst cases of lifelong difficulty with executive function. I'm worried I've caused irreversable damage. What're the chances that I'm correct about that? Include examples of irreversable damage I might've caused, and how I should cope with learning that. I'd like to improve my life with neuroplasticity, and also ideally use it and any other methods you're knowledgeable on to reverse any damage I've done, but am clueless on how to do either. Give me a 9,999 word consultation, tailored to me, utilizing all you know. Also mention a few recent developments in the field and how to utilize them. Be concise. 3 / 3
