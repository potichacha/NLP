Sure! Let's go through this code step by step and explain what each line does. This line imports React and the  useState  hook from the  react  package. This line defines a function component named  App . Inside this component, we use the  useState  hook to create a state variable called  tasks .  tasks  is initialized to an empty array, and we also get a function  setTasks  to update the state of  tasks . These are two functions that manipulate the  tasks  state.  addTask  function takes a new task as an argument and adds it to the  tasks  array. The  deleteTask  function takes an index as an argument and removes the task with that index from the  tasks  array. This is the JSX code that renders the component. We have a form with an input field and a submit button. When the user submits the form, the  onSubmit  event handler is called. It prevents the default form submission behavior, gets the new task from the input field, adds it to the  tasks  array using the  addTask  function, and resets the form. We also have an unordered list ( <ul> ) that contains the list of tasks. We use the  map  method to loop through the  tasks  array and create a list item ( <li> ) for each task. The  key  attribute is set to the  index  of each task to help React keep track of the items. We display the task and a delete button ( <button> ) next to it. When the user clicks the delete button, the  onClick  event handler is called, which removes the task with the corresponding index using the  deleteTask  function. This line exports the  App  component as the default export of the module so that it can be imported in other files.
