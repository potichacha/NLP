how to run a nats server with a local docker. the server should run on another port than the default and needs to have jetstream enabled. the nats server storage should be in a volume that persists the data when the container is restarted.

To run a NATS server with a local Docker, you can follow these steps: Now, you should have a NATS server running on port 4223 with JetStream enabled, and the data will persist in the specified Docker volume even if the container is restarted.

Please create a bash script that contains all those steps in one file

Create a file named  setup_nats_server.sh  and paste the following content into it: Before running the script, make sure you have Docker installed and running on your system. To execute the script, open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the  setup_nats_server.sh  file, and run the following commands: This script will create the necessary configuration files, build the custom NATS server image, create a Docker volume for data persistence, and run the NATS server container with the custom image and Docker volume.

Please make the port configurable on the command line but keep the 4223 as default. In addition, make it possible to re-run the script, which should stop a already running container and recreate the volume if it is already created. The script should not create errors when re-started like that.

To make the port configurable and allow the script to be re-run without errors, modify the  setup_nats_server.sh  script as follows: With these modifications, the script will now accept an optional port number as its first argument, defaulting to 4223 if no argument is provided. The script will also stop and remove any existing container with the name  my-nats-server  before creating a new one, and it will only create the volume if it doesn't already exist. To run the script, make it executable and run it with the desired port number (or no argument for the default 4223):

I get invalid argument "/etc/nats/nats-server.conf" for "-c, --cpu-shares" flag: strconv.ParseInt: parsing "/etc/nats/nats-server.conf": invalid syntax

Apologies for the confusion. It seems that the  -c  flag is being misinterpreted as the  --cpu-shares  flag. To fix this issue, use the long-form flag  --config  instead of  -c . Update the last line of the  setup_nats_server.sh  script as follows: Now, you can run the script as before, and it should work without any errors:

Oh. I just see that the problem arose from me changing your code because my shell code linter suggested adding double quotes around the used variables and I placed one of them wrong.
