explain html elements in detail

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page, and they define the structure, content, and layout of the page. An HTML element is a combination of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The start tag begins with the "<" character, followed by the tag name, and ends with the ">" character. The end tag begins with "</" followed by the tag name, and ends with the ">" character. The content is the information or text contained within the start and end tags. Here are some commonly used HTML elements: Heading Elements: There are six levels of heading elements, from H1 to H6, where H1 represents the most important heading and H6 represents the least important heading. Paragraph Element: This element is used to create a paragraph of text on a web page. Link Element: This element is used to create a hyperlink to another web page or a specific section of a web page.
