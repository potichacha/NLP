Please explain in detail why it's funny.

The humor in this joke lies in the pun and the double meaning of the word "plethora." The joke goes as follows: There was a funeral. A person went up to the spouse of the deceased and asked if they could say a word. The spouse said yes, and the person said "plethora". The spouse thanked them and said, "that means a lot". In this joke, the person who wants to say a word at the funeral chooses to say "plethora." "Plethora" is a noun that means "a large or excessive amount of something." When the spouse of the deceased thanks the person and says "that means a lot," the phrase has a double meaning. The spouse could be expressing gratitude for the person\
