{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Certainly, I can help you with that. Please provide your data, and I will guide you through the process of calculating Cohen's Kappa coefficient. To calculate Cohen's Kappa coefficient, we need to first create a contingency table that shows the observed frequency of agreement and disagreement between the two coders. The contingency table should have two rows and two columns, where the rows correspond to the categories assigned by the first coder and the columns correspond to the categories assigned by the second coder. Here's an example of what the contingency table might look like: In this table, a, b, c, and d represent the observed frequency of agreement and disagreement between the two coders, where: To calculate Cohen's Kappa coefficient, we need to first calculate the observed agreement between the two coders, which is given by the following formula: Observed agreement = (a + d) / (a + b + c + d) Next, we need to calculate the expected agreement between the two coders, which is the amount of agreement we would expect if the coders were randomly assigning categories to the terms. The expected agreement is given by the following formula: Expected agreement = (a + b) * (a + c) / (a + b + c + d)^2 + (d + b) * (d + c) / (a + b + c + d)^2 Finally, we can calculate Cohen's Kappa coefficient using the following formula: Kappa = (Observed agreement - Expected agreement) / (1 - Expected agreement) The value of Cohen's Kappa coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where: I hope this helps, and if you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask!"}

Here's what the contingency table would look like: In this table, the values represent the observed frequency of agreement and disagreement between the two coders. For example, there is one term that both coders categorized as M1, and there is one term that CoderA categorized as M7 while CoderB categorized as L8. Next, we need to calculate the marginal totals for each category, which represent
