I have a PWA, I want to push notification to it, what are the steps for achieving this?

To send push notifications to your PWA (Progressive Web App), you need to follow these general steps: Set up a push notification service: Choose a push notification service provider, such as Firebase Cloud Messaging, OneSignal, or Pusher, and create an account. These services provide APIs that you can use to send push notifications to your PWA. Register your PWA: Register your PWA with the push notification service provider. This involves creating a configuration file that contains your PWA's details, such as its name and URL. Add a service worker: A service worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background and can receive push notifications. You'll need to add a service worker to your PWA if you haven't already done so. Request permission: When a user visits your PWA, you'll need to request permission to send them push notifications. You can use the  Notification  API to do this. Handle notifications: When a user receives a push notification, you'll need to handle it in your PWA. You can use the  push  event of the service worker to do this. Send notifications: Finally, you can send push notifications to your PWA using the APIs provided by your chosen push notification service. It's important to note that different push notification service providers may have slightly different APIs and implementation details. Therefore, you should consult the documentation provided by your chosen service for more specific instructions.

How does it work? Does the service worker keeps a websocket connection to the push notification service in the background?
