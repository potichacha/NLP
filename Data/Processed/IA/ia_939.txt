The dermatologist performs a thorough skin examination and identifies a melanoma. The patient undergoes a biopsy, which confirms the diagnosis. The patient is referred to a specialist for Mohs surgery. The surgery is successful in removing the melanoma, and the patient is scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to monitor for recurrence or new skin lesions. Year 2: Recovery and regular check-ups In the second year, the patient attends regular follow-up appointments with her dermatologist. The dermatologist continues to monitor her skin for any signs of new or recurring melanoma, as well as other skin conditions. The patient is advised to perform self-examinations regularly and to report any changes in her skin immediately. She is also encouraged to practice sun safety and maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of melanoma recurrence. Year 3: Monitoring and education In the third year, the patient remains cancer-free and continues with regular dermatologist appointments. She has learned to recognize the early signs of melanoma and is diligent about self-examinations. During her appointments, the dermatologist emphasizes the importance of sun protection, including the use of sunscreen and protective clothing. The patient is also educated on other risk factors for melanoma, such as genetic predisposition and family history. Year 4: Continued monitoring and emotional support By the fourth year, the patient is still cancer-free but may experience anxiety related to the possibility of recurrence. The dermatologist remains vigilant in monitoring her skin and provides emotional support by discussing her concerns and fears. The patient is encouraged to seek additional support from cancer support groups or mental health professionals if needed. Year 5: Long-term follow-up and lifestyle management In the fifth year, the patient has successfully reached the five-year milestone with no signs of melanoma recurrence. She continues with regular dermatologist appointments and is advised to maintain her sun safety practices and healthy lifestyle. The dermatologist also discusses long-term follow-up plans, which may include a transition to less frequent appointments, while still emphasizing the importance of regular self-examinations and prompt reporting of any concerns.
