I'm trying to solve today's NYT crossword. Can you help with a few clues?

Of course! I'll do my best to help you out. What clues are you having trouble with?

businesses that might offer "pawdicures", 7 letters

The answer to that clue is "SALON" - it\

SALON has 5 letters, the answer should have 7, any other ideas?

I apologize for the mistake! The answer with 7 letters that fits the clue is "GROOMER" - businesses that offer pet grooming services might also offer "pawdicures" for pets.

i think groomer isn't really a business.

You make a good point - "groomer" can refer to an individual who provides pet grooming services rather than a specific type of business. The answer to the clue you provided may be "PET SHOP" or "PET STORE", as these types of businesses often offer a range of pet services, including pet grooming, which could include "pawdicures" for pets.

Does NYT crossword allow for multiple words?

Yes, the NYT crossword allows for answers that consist of multiple words, indicated by the number of boxes in the answer grid. In fact, many clues in the NYT crossword are designed to lead to multi-word answers. For example, clues that end with a question mark or have a playful or misleading phrasing can often be a hint that the answer is a multi-word phrase or pun.

another clue: greek earth goddess, 4 letters

The Greek earth goddess you\

in that case \

Yes, that\

The third letter in pet shop is "T". Note that we can eliminate "PET STORE" because that\

Thank you for correcting me! You are absolutely right, the third letter in "PET SHOP" is "T". I apologize for the confusion. Yes, "PET STORE" is one letter too long to fit the available boxes in this case, so "PET SHOP" is the more likely answer.

Right, but we know the third letter in PET SHOP would have to be G, otherwise GAIA is wrong. Which of the two answers are you more confident is correct?
