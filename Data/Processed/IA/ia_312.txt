The proposed project involves the analysis of satellite imagery of a small portion of the Sundarbans region, using Python programming language. The imagery used is acquired through the Sentinel-2 satellite, and consists of a data set of 954Ã—298 pixels, with 12 bands with a spectral resolution varying from 10 to 60 meters. To perform various operations on this dataset, the project will be using several Python libraries, including EarthPy, RasterIO, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data visualization and analysis. The EarthPy library is a collection of functions and tools for working with spatial data using open-source Python libraries, including Pandas, Geopandas, and Rasterio. Rasterio is a Python library for working with geospatial raster data, and provides tools for reading and writing geospatial raster datasets. The Matplotlib library provides a comprehensive collection of 2D and 3D plotting tools, and will be used to plot different bands of the image, plot the RGB composite image, plot histograms of each band, and plot the analysis results. The Plotly library is a powerful tool for creating interactive, web-based data visualizations, and will be used for presenting the analysis results in a user-friendly manner. The project will be divided into four modules, including Data Acquisition, Image Processing, Data Analysis, and Reporting and Presentation. The Data Acquisition module will be responsible for reading data from the specified data source, pre-processing the acquired data, and saving the acquired and pre-processed data. The Image Processing module will be responsible for performing various operations on the acquired and pre-processed data, such as plotting different bands of the image, plotting the RGB composite image, applying stretch to the RGB composite image, plotting histograms of each band, and calculating the NDVI index from the bands. The Data Analysis module will be responsible for calculating various vegetation, water, and geology indices from the bands, performing terrain analysis on the data, and generating a report of the analysis. Finally, the Reporting and Presentation module will be responsible for generating the final report, plotting the analysis results, and presenting the analysis results in a user-friendly manner. this my propose system can you make proposed system architecture from it
