Decide on a famous scene from star wars and rewrite it as a play by Shakespeare

Title: The Tragic Duel of Master and Apprentice Dramatis Personae: (Scene: The volcanic planet of Mustafar, a fiery hellscape. OBI-WAN KENOBI and ANAKIN SKYWALKER, now DARTH VADER, stand facing each other.) CHORUS: In this tempestuous land of fire and smoke, Two former brethren meet to wage a war. The once-strong bond of friendship broke, And now their blades shall cross, to settle score. OBI-WAN: Prithee, Anakin, dost thou see the path Thou tread upon? 'Tis dark and treach'rous, and 'Twill lead thee to thy doom, a woeful fate. Turn back, my friend, and join me in the light. ANAKIN: Nay, Obi-Wan, thou dost not understand. The dark side holds the pow'r that I do seek, And in its grasp, I'll save the one I love. I cannot turn away, for I am lost. OBI-WAN: Anakin, thou hast been deceived, I fear, By Emperor Palpatine's cunning tongue. His words are poison, and his heart is black. He seeks but to control thee, for his gain. ANAKIN: No more of this, my patience wanes apace! If thou dost stand against me, thou art mine enemy. I'll show thee how the dark side's pow'r hath made me strong, And thou shalt fall before my vengeful blade. (They ignite their lightsabers and engage in a fierce duel.) CHORUS: As once they fought as one, now they do clash, With every stroke and parry, love is lost. The fire of Mustafar, a fitting stage, For this tragic duel of master and apprentice. (They continue to duel until OBI-WAN gains the high ground.) OBI-WAN: I warn thee, Anakin, surrender now. I hold the high ground, and thy chance is slim. Renounce the dark side, ere it be too late. ANAKIN: Thou underestimates my pow'r, old friend. I shall not yield, nor shall I be o'erthrown. (ANAKIN lunges at OBI-WAN, who severs his limbs with a swift stroke. ANAKIN falls to the ground, close to the lava's edge.) OBI-WAN (tearfully): Thou wert the Chosen One, to bring us peace, To vanquish darkness, and restore the light. Yet thou hast fallen, to the dark side's sway, And left our bond in tatters, naught but pain. (As OBI-WAN walks away, EMPEROR PALPATINE arrives to retrieve the defeated ANAKIN.) CHORUS: Thus ends the tragic duel, with hearts now rent, And destinies forever intertwined. In time, the wounds may heal, but scars remain, As testament to love and loyalty betrayed.
