Of course, I'm ready to adventure! Let's get started with creating your character for Curse of Strahd. First, what race would you like to play as? The available options are human, dwarf, elf, halfling, dragonborn, gnome, half-elf, half-orc, and tiefling. Each race has different abilities and traits that will affect your gameplay.

I'd like to play as Dragonborn

Great choice! Dragonborn are fierce and powerful creatures with a breath weapon that can deal elemental damage. What class would you like to play as? The available options are barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, warlock, and wizard. Each class has its own unique set of skills and abilities that will shape your character's playstyle.

Paladin

Excellent! Paladins are holy warriors who use their divine powers to smite their enemies and protect their allies. Let's move on to determining your ability scores. There are six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability has a score between 1 and 20, with 10 being the average. You can assign scores to these abilities by rolling dice, using the standard array, or using the point buy system. Which method would you like to use?

I'd like to use the point buy system

Okay, under the point buy system, you have 27 points to spend across your abilities, with each ability score costing a certain amount of points. Here's a table to help you: So, how would you like to allocate your points across your abilities? Remember that Dragonborn get a +2 bonus to Strength and a +1 bonus to Charisma.

This will give you some additional proficiencies, equipment, and a unique feature based on your character's backstory.
