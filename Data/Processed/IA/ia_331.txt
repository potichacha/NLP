Write a poem about the Lakers

In purple and gold they take the floor, The Lakers, mighty and strong once more. Their history rich, their legacy grand, They are a team that can truly command. With Kobe and Shaq, they soared to great heights, Their rivalry with the Celtics, a famous fight. And though their journey has seen some falls, The Lakers always rise, standing tall. From Magic to Kareem, to LeBron and AD, They've had the best of the best, indeed. Their fans, a passionate and loyal crew, Cheering on their heroes, in all they do. The Staples Center, their home sweet home, Echoes with roars, as they reach for the dome. The Lakers, a team of champions true, In basketball lore, their place is due. So let us hail the Lakers, with pride and joy, For they are a team that can never be destroyed. In purple and gold, they'll always shine, The Lakers, a legacy forever divine.
