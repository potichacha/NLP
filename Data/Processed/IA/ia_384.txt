I want to create an animated 3d scatterplot. But Im not getting the desired output. Please see my code and tell me what issues there could be:  1) Here is my HTML       Project 2 - Gapminder Clone

It is difficult to determine the issues without more information about the desired output and the data being used in the visualization. However, a few things that could be causing issues with the animation include: It would be helpful to see the JSON data file and to know what the desired output is supposed to look like.

I want to create an animated 3d scatterplot that shows how the family income (x-axis) and life expectancy (y-axis) of different races in the US (white, black, all) has changed from 1980-2018.
