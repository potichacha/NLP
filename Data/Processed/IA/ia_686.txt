I want you to identify security vulnerabilities in the following file: user nginx; worker_processes 1; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn; pid /var/run/nginx.pid; load_module modules/ngx_http_perl_module.so; env GROUP_ID; env PORT_PREFIX; events {  worker_connections 1024; } http {  perl_set $GROUP_ID \

This means that all communication between the client and server will be unencrypted, which could expose sensitive data to eavesdropping. You should consider enabling SSL/TLS by using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Server_name set to localhost: The server_name directive is set to \
