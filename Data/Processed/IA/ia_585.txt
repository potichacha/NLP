However, here are some possible insights: Housing: Lower-income households may struggle to afford housing, particularly in cities with high living costs. They may live in smaller apartments or houses, or have multiple roommates to split costs. Transportation: Lower-income households may rely on public transportation or carpooling to get around, as they may not be able to afford a car or its associated expenses. Food: Lower-income households may have to be more careful about their food budgets, and may rely on cheaper options such as processed foods, fast food, or bulk purchases. They may also use coupons or shop at discount grocery stores. Healthcare: Lower-income households may have less access to healthcare, as they may not be able to afford insurance or copays. They may also be more likely to delay medical treatment due to cost concerns. Entertainment: Lower-income households may have fewer opportunities for entertainment, such as dining out or going to movies. They may instead rely on free activities, such as spending time in parks or libraries.
