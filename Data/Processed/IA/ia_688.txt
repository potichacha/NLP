There are many potential sources of RF interference that can affect the operation of RF systems used in electronic warfare, surveillance, radar and wireless data communications. These can include multipath or adjacent channel interference, Rayleigh channel fading or scintillation or rogue carriers transmitting in the band either intentionally or erroneously. RF interference can be transitory and challenging to observe in the operational environment, however, by capturing the RF spectrum over an extended period of time you can identify and analyze potential sources of RF interference. A PXIe data streaming and analysis solution from Bird and Keysight Technologies can be used to record and analyze the operational spectral environment of an RF system in order to identify events causing RF interference. The solution utilizes the Keysight M9392A PXIe vector signal analyzer and M9202A PXIe IF digitizer as the RF front end to capture the RF spectrum. This is streamed to a directly attached RAID storage array for subsequent analysis using Bird’s Spectro-X multi-channel signal analysis toolkit. The Keysight M9392A vector signal analyzer and M9202A IF digitizer provide a compact cost effective solution for the streaming of RF spectrum with bandwidths up to 100 MHz and center frequencies up to 26.5 GHz. This economical, high performance capability, when combined with JMR Electronics’ BluStor PCIe RAID0 storage arrays can provide more than 13 hours of spectrum memory allowing long sequences of RF data to be captured under operational conditions. An RF bandwidth of 100 MHz requires 600 MB/s to be streamed to the disk array and the resulting files can be terabytes in length. TheBird Spectro-X multi-channel signal analysis toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools that allows the Identify and eliminate RF interference with PXIe data streaming and analysis RF Interference Analysis Keysight Technologies and Bird – Capture and analyze the operational RF spectrum – Signal analysis software identifies potential causes of RF interference – PXIe data streaming and storage captures operational RF spectrum – Large RAID0 storage array for data capture – Uses Keysight PXIe instrumentation  with Bird analysis software – Accelerates the identification and elimination of RF interference user to search through up to four capture files simultaneously in order to tag and compare the location of all carriers present,
