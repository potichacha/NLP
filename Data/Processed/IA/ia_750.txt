Write steps to download text content of a web url using puppetier node js library.

To download the text content of a web URL using the Puppeteer Node.js library, follow these steps: Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, install the Puppeteer library using npm or yarn: or Create a new JavaScript file, e.g.,  download-text.js , to write your script. At the beginning of your  download-text.js  file, import the Puppeteer library: Create an asynchronous function to handle the process of launching a browser, opening a new page, navigating to the target URL, and extracting the text content. Call the  downloadTextContent()  function with your desired URL, and use a  .then()  block to handle the result. You can either print the text content to the console or save it to a file. Save your  download-text.js  file and execute it using Node.js: This script will download the text content of the specified URL and print it to the console.

is there a better ls command which shows filesize in human readable format like mb gb etc?

Yes, you can use the  -h  flag with the  ls  command to display file sizes in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB, etc.). To do this, use the  ls  command with the  -lh  flags. The  -l  flag displays the files in a long listing format, and the  -h  flag shows file sizes in a human-readable format. Here's the command: This command will display the files in the current directory in a long listing format with human-readable file sizes. For example, the output will look like: In this example, the file sizes are displayed in KB, MB, and GB as appropriate for each file.

In the puppetier example where does the document object comes from ?

In the Puppeteer example, the  document  object comes from the browser context. Puppeteer allows you to interact with the web page loaded in a Chromium browser instance using a headless or headed mode. When you use  page.evaluate() , you can pass a function that will be executed in the browser context, meaning it will have access to the browser's DOM and global objects like  document . Here's the relevant part of the example: page.evaluate()  takes a function as an argument, which is then executed in the browser context. In this case, the function returns the  textContent  of the  documentElement , which corresponds to the entire content of the loaded web page. When the function is executed inside the browser context, it has access to the  document  object just like you would have in a regular browser environment when writing client-side JavaScript. This allows you to interact with the DOM, retrieve data, or manipulate the page content.
