what is crowd sourced data

Crowd sourced data is information that is collected from a large number of individuals, typically through an online platform or mobile app. The term "crowd sourcing" refers to the practice of obtaining input or content from a large number of people, often via the internet. Crowd sourced data can come in various forms, including text, images, audio, and video. Examples of crowd sourced data include product reviews, user-generated content on social media, data from fitness trackers, and information collected through citizen science projects. The benefits of crowd sourced data include its potential for collecting large amounts of information quickly and cost-effectively. It also provides access to diverse perspectives and experiences, which can be valuable for research, product development, and decision-making. However, crowd sourced data also has some limitations, including the potential for biased or inaccurate information due to the lack of control over data quality and representativeness. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate and validate crowd sourced data before using it for analysis or decision-making purposes.
