I am writing an email directed towards a upstanding neurosurgeon to speak at TEDxUniMelb. Here is what I have written so far. I want you to improve the email to make it come across more friendly, to make me come across as more charismatic and to help me build a relationship with her that lasts well into the future. Dear Prof Kate Drummond, Thank you for taking the time to meet with me last year. Your advice was valuable, and helped me narrow my specialty interests. I am writing to you this morning to invite you to express your interest to speak at the TEDxUniMelb Conference in May. If this is something that suits your busy schedule, please let me know, and maybe list a few topics that may become the focus of your TED Talk.  I must mention that this is still at the expression of interest stage, and is not a confirmation of a speaking slot but I would be surprised if any of my colleagues did not prioritise you above other potential speakers given your prestigious standing in the community. I have provided important information regarding this year's conference below Conference Details 26th May: 6pm-8:30pm at the University of Melbourne Schedule  6-7pm: Speakers present  7-7:45pm: Dinner and networking  7:45-8:30pm: Speakers present Details Speakers have 18 minutes maximum, with the typical talk going for around 7-10 minutes The conference may be recorded and placed on TEDx website There are no corporate sponsors All the best,
