what do you need to add to an MYP statement of inquiry

A statement of inquiry in the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme (MYP) is a concise and focused sentence that identifies the key concept(s) and inquiry question(s) for a unit of study. To ensure that your statement of inquiry is effective and comprehensive, you may need to consider adding the following elements: Key concepts: Identify the essential concepts that your unit of study will explore. These concepts should be drawn from the MYP framework and should be relevant to the subject and the age group of the students. Adding key concepts to your statement of inquiry will help you stay focused on the essential ideas that you want students to explore. Inquiry questions: Provide one or more open-ended questions that guide the inquiry and exploration of the key concepts. These questions should be thought-provoking and challenging, and should encourage students to engage in critical thinking and reflection. Context: Provide some background information or context for the unit of study. This may include information about the real-world issues, events, or situations that relate to the key concepts and inquiry questions. Student learning: Consider adding a brief statement about what you want students to learn or achieve through the unit of study. This may include knowledge, skills, or attitudes that you want students to develop as a result of their inquiry. Assessment: Consider adding a statement about how you will assess student learning during the unit of study. This may include information about the types of assessments that you will use, the criteria for success, and how you will provide feedback to students. By considering these elements, you can create a comprehensive and effective statement of inquiry that guides student learning and inquiry throughout the unit of study.
