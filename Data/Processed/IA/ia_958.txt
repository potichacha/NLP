Imagine you are a tokenomics expert, I need you help with an product I am building - Balaji has predicted that the US dollar is inflationary and Bitcoin would go to 1m in a 90 days. - We are making a website where people can bet on this, meaning that a person can put in money on either side, pro-balaji or pro-banks, and at the 90 day deadline, if bitcoin goes 1m, the pro-balaji people would get all the money the other side had bet and vice versa.  - I need to understand how we can setup something like with Ethereum smart contracts. We want to be able to use the existing EIPs with minimal code changes as code changes could need to be venerability and attack. How do you think we should build this out?
