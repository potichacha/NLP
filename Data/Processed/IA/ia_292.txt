bulid a cnn classifier form my dataset which consists of two coloumns one contains all the c progmraning code and the other is the label with is rating of the code so make train test and validation on these

To build a CNN classifier for your dataset, you will first need to preprocess your data and then split it into training, validation, and testing sets. Here are the general steps you can follow: Preprocessing your data: a. Tokenize your C programming code to convert it into a numerical representation that can be understood by a CNN. b. Normalize your numerical representation to ensure that all features have similar ranges and that your model can converge faster. Splitting your data: a. Split your data into training, validation, and testing sets. A common split is 60% for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Building your CNN model: a. Define your CNN architecture, including the number of layers, the number of filters, and the activation function for each layer. b. Compile your model with the appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics. Training your model: a. Train your model on your training data. b. Use your validation set to tune your hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Evaluating your model: a. Use your testing data to evaluate your model's performance. b. Use appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess your model's performance. Here is some sample code to help you get started: This is just a sample code to get you started. You can modify this code
