if i give you 2 codes can you tell which developer is more experienced

As an AI language model, I can analyze and provide insights into code quality and style, but I cannot make judgments on the experience of individual developers. Experience is a complex measure that includes many factors beyond the code, such as a developer's knowledge, skill, and ability to work within a team, and it cannot be easily determined by looking at just two pieces of code. However, I can provide feedback on the readability, maintainability, and organization of the code, which can give some insight into the coding proficiency of the developer.
