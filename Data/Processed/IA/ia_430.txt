{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Figure 1 depicts a method for replacing a damaged stone panel on a building's facade. The process involves barricading and covering the area of work for safety purposes. A traffic marshall is assigned to control the ground traffic. A safety catch netting is installed between the structure wall element and the BMU platform, and suction cups are attached to the existing stone panel. The existing sealant is removed to expose holding elements, and a safety belt is installed around the stone panel and connected to both the structure wall element and the BMU platform. The stone panel is then carefully removed, lowered to the ground, and replaced with a new stone panel using the same safety measures. New sealant is installed around the new stone panel to preve
