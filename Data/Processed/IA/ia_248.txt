Are you familiar with the npm package Nodemailer and would you be able to give me tips on how to use it?

Yes, I'm familiar with Nodemailer, which is a popular npm package used for sending emails from a Node.js application. Here are some tips on how to use Nodemailer: These are the basic steps for using Nodemailer to send emails from a Node.js application. There are many other configuration options and features available in Nodemailer, which you can explore in the official documentation.

Suppose I wanted to use transporter.templateSender instead of transporter.sendMail. What would the difference there look like?

transporter.sendMail()  is used to send simple emails with plain text or HTML content. On the other hand,  transporter.templateSender()  is used to send emails with dynamic content using templates. With  transporter.templateSender() , you can define a template that contains placeholders for dynamic content, such as the recipient's name, order details, etc. You can then pass an object containing the dynamic content to the  templateSender()  method, which will generate the final email by replacing the placeholders with the actual content. Here's an example of how to use  transporter.templateSender() : In this example, we are using the  templateSender()  method to send an order confirmation email. The email contains dynamic content such as the recipient's name, order details, and total price. The  template  property specifies the name of the template file, and the  context  property contains the dynamic content. The  templateDir  property specifies the directory where the template file is located, and the  engine  property specifies the template engine used to render the template. Note that you need to set up a template engine such as EJS or Handlebars to use  transporter.templateSender() . You can also use other template engines supported by Nodemailer or create your own custom template engine.

What do you mean by setting up a template engine? Would that require an additional npm package in the case of ejs?
