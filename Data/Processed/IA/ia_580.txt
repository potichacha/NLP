How do I implement a hexagonal architecture in c++

Implementing hexagonal architecture in C++ involves dividing your codebase into three main components: application, domain, and infrastructure. The application component contains the user interface and the use cases that implement the business logic. The domain component contains the domain entities, which represent the concepts and behaviors of the business domain, and the domain services, which encapsulate the complex domain logic. Finally, the infrastructure component contains the implementation details of the external systems that the application uses, such as databases, file systems, and web services. Here are the steps to implement a hexagonal architecture in C++: Define the domain entities and domain services: Identify the core concepts of your business domain and define them as domain entities. Implement the behaviors of these entities as domain services. Define the interfaces: Define interfaces that the domain services will use to interact with the application and the infrastructure. These interfaces should be defined in terms of the domain entities and not in terms of implementation details. Implement the application component: Implement the use cases and the user interface. The use cases should use the interfaces defined in step 2 to interact with the domain services. Implement the infrastructure component: Implement the classes that interact with external systems, such as databases or web services. These classes should implement the interfaces defined in step 2. Wire everything together: Finally, wire everything together. Create instances of the infrastructure classes and pass them to the domain services through their interfaces. Then, create instances of the domain services and pass them to the application component through their interfaces. Here's an example implementation of a simple hexagonal architecture in C++: In this example, the domain entities are represented by the  User  class. The domain service  UserService  provides methods for getting and saving users, and it uses the `User
