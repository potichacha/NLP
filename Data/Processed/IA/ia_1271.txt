I heard a jobe about "no fans, only friends", do you know it?

I'm not familiar with that specific joke, but it seems to be playing on the concept that a person doesn't have fans (people who admire or follow their work) but rather friends who support them. This could be interpreted as a humble or lighthearted way of saying that someone values meaningful relationships over having a large following. If you provide more context or the full joke, I'd be happy to help explain it further.

I think it was some kind of pun related to "onlyfans"

Ah, I understand now. The joke you\
