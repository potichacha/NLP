Please draw and explain the architecture of the voting system made with Mina Protocol's ZKAPP.

The voting system made with Mina Protocol's ZKAPP is a decentralized application that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable privacy-preserving and verifiable voting. The architecture of the voting system consists of three main components: The frontend: This is the interface that the user interacts with. It can be a web or mobile application that enables users to cast their votes, view the results of the election, and perform other actions related to the voting process. The backend: This component is responsible for processing user inputs and generating the necessary cryptographic proofs using ZKAPP. The backend also stores the voting data and other relevant information in a decentralized and secure manner. The Mina blockchain: This is the underlying infrastructure that supports the voting system. The Mina blockchain is used to store the cryptographic proofs generated by the backend, making the voting process transparent and auditable by anyone. The architecture of the voting system can be represented in the following diagram: In the voting system, the backend is responsible for generating ZKP-based proofs that guarantee the validity and privacy of the votes. The ZKAPP protocol is used to generate these proofs. To ensure privacy, the backend generates a random nonce and encrypts the vote using homomorphic encryption. The encrypted vote is then combined with the nonce to generate a ZKP that proves that the encrypted vote is valid without revealing the vote itself. The backend also generates additional ZKPs to ensure that each voter can only cast one vote, and to prove that the tally of the votes is correct. These proofs are stored on the Mina blockchain, which allows anyone to verify that the voting process was conducted fairly and without tampering. Overall, the voting system made with Mina Protocol's ZKAPP provides a secure, private, and verifiable way for people to cast their votes without the need for a centralized authority.
