"We started two weeks with the soft launch of our socials for the Web3 game Crystale. For further explanation regarding the game I recommend reading the lite deck. At the start of the third quarter we would like to organize a free mint. The content in the free mint will have some artworks, BTS footage of development but most importantly, it is an access pass to our future mints that we will organise until the pre-sale. The free mint will have a supply between the 500 and 1000. But this number is also strong dependable on our community growth. For that we need to grow our community, especially our Discord and Twitter. Now of course we would like to grow as quick as possible, but more importantly. We would like to gather as much gamers and anime enthousiast instead of web3 people who just want to make a quick buck by flipping something we will sell. So our targeting should be aimed at web2/3 gamers and anime enthousiast. Of course we know that we can not have that target group 100%, but we believe that if there is a focus on it we will eventually get the right people in the discord."
