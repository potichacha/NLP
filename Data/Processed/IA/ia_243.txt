3 tire web application deployment using docker

Deploying a three-tier web application using Docker typically involves creating three separate Docker containers for each tier: the frontend, backend, and database. Here are the general steps to deploy a three-tier web application using Docker: Dockerize your application code: Dockerizing your application code involves creating a Dockerfile for each of the three tiers that specifies the environment and dependencies required to run the code. Build the Docker images: Once you have the Dockerfiles, you can use the Docker build command to create the Docker images for each tier. Create a Docker network: To enable communication between the containers, you need to create a Docker network. Start the containers: Once you have the Docker images and network, you can start the containers for each tier, making sure to map the appropriate ports and volumes. Here's an example of a docker-compose file that can be used to deploy a three-tier web application: In this example, we have three services defined:  db ,  backend , and  frontend . The  db  service uses the official Postgres image, while the  backend  and  frontend  services use the Dockerfiles located in the  ./backend  and  ./frontend  directories, respectively. The  backend  service specifies the environment variables required to connect to the database container and maps port 5000 to allow communication with the frontend. The  frontend  service maps port 80 to allow access to the web application and depends on the  backend  service to be running first. With this docker-compose file in place, you can use the Docker Compose command to start the containers and deploy your three-tier web application: This will start the containers in the background, allowing you to access your web application by visiting  http://localhost  in your browser.
