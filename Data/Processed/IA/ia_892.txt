Is there a library in go that will generate migrations for me? I have a directory containing my sql DDL files. Let's name this directory `schema` I have a directory of migrations this tool would * understand the current state of the migrations * be able to read the sql files in my directory `schema` * calculate the difference between migrations and files in `schema` * generate a migration including the sql statement needed to alter, create or drop tables. In python, `alembic` does something like this. I'm looking for something similar just in go.

Can you give an example of `goose` generating migration statements after ingesting existing migrations and sql DDL files?
