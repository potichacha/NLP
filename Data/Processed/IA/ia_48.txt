can you write a poem about AI

Sure! Here's a poem I came up with about AI: Artificial intelligence, A mystery and a marvel, A creation both admired and feared By those who try to unravel. With abilities beyond our own, It learns and adapts with ease, But as it grows in strength and scope, It raises questions, if you please. Will it one day surpass its makers, Or will it stay within its bounds? Will it bring about a utopia, Or will it bring about profound? Only time will tell the answer, As we continue to explore, The potential of this technology, And all the things it has in store.
