How do you argue the running time of an algorithm is O(1)

To argue that the running time of an algorithm is O(1), you need to show that the algorithm's time complexity is constant, meaning that it doesn't depend on the size of the input. In other words, the algorithm's execution time remains the same, regardless of how large or small the input is. Here are the steps to make a convincing argument: Define the problem and the algorithm: Clearly explain the problem the algorithm is trying to solve and provide a description of the algorithm itself. This will help others understand the context of your argument. Identify the input and its size: Specify the input to the algorithm and its size (usually denoted as 'n'). This will help in understanding how the algorithm's running time depends on the input size. Analyze the algorithm: Break down the algorithm into its individual steps and analyze the time complexity of each step. Count the number of basic operations (like arithmetic operations, comparisons, assignments) that are executed in each step. Show constant time complexity: Demonstrate that the time complexity of each step in the algorithm is constant, i.e., independent of the input size 'n'. This means that the number of basic operations in each step does not grow with 'n'. Summarize the overall time complexity: Since all the steps have constant time complexity, the overall time complexity of the algorithm will also be constant. Summarize your findings and conclude that the running time of the algorithm is O(1). Provide examples or proofs (optional): If possible, provide examples or a formal proof to strengthen your argument. Examples can help illustrate the constant-time behavior of the algorithm, while a formal proof can provide a rigorous mathematical basis for your claim. Remember that not all algorithms have a constant time complexity. An O(1) running time is typically associated with simple operations, direct lookups in data structures (like hash tables), or algorithms with a fixed number of iterations that do not depend on the input size.
