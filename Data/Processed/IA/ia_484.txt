You were such an important part of my journey towards healing, and I can't express my gratitude enough. Even though we sometimes butted heads, I always knew that you had my best interests at heart. You pushed me to be my best self, even when it was hard. And through it all, you"}

So here\'s a card with love and cheers, To one of the best technicians ever, dear! Love, [Your Name]'}

Your red hair was fiery, just like your heart, And you never let me fall apart. You gave me snacks, and oh so much more, And laughed with me until our bellies were sore. I'm so grateful for all that you've done, And I'll always treasure the memories we've won. You taught me to be strong, and to never give in, And I know with your help, I can always win. So here's a card, to say thank you so much, For being there for me, with your gentle touch. Love, [Your Name]"}
