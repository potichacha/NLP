Is there inductance torque sqrt relationship

I'm not entirely sure what you're asking. However, I'm assuming you're asking about the relationship between torque and inductance in an electric motor. In an electric motor, the torque produced is related to the inductance of the motor windings. Specifically, the torque produced by a motor is proportional to the square root of the inductance of the windings. This is because the inductance of the windings affects the current flow through the motor, and the current flow is what produces the magnetic field that generates the torque. A higher inductance means that the current will change more slowly, which in turn means that the magnetic field will change more slowly, resulting in a lower torque output. Therefore, if you increase the inductance of the motor, you will decrease the torque output, and vice versa. The relationship between torque and inductance is not a simple linear one, but rather a square root relationship.
