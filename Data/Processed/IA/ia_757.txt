how can I transform the getPosition method of antv/g's group in zrender?

To transform the  getPosition  method of antv/g's group in ZRender, you can use the  getBoundingRect  method of ZRender's Group component. The  getBoundingRect  method returns the bounding box of the group, which includes the position, width, and height of the group. Here's an example of how you can use the  getBoundingRect  method to get the position of a group in ZRender: In this example, the position of the group is  [0, 0] , which is the top-left corner of the bounding box. You can use the  x  and  y  properties of the  boundingRect  object to get the x and y coordinates of the position.

are you sure that right?

I apologize, it looks like my previous response was incorrect. The  getBoundingRect  method in ZRender returns the bounding box of the group, which includes the position, width, and height of the shapes contained within the group, not the position of the group itself. To get the position of a ZRender group, you can use the  position  property of the group. This property represents the position of the group and can be accessed or modified directly. Here's an example of how you can use the  position  property to get and set the position of a group in ZRender: In this example, the position of the group is set to  [100, 200]  and can be retrieved using the  position  property.

I apologize, it seems that my previous response was incorrect. To get the position of a ZRender group, you can use the  position  property of the group, not the  getBoundingRect  method.

no, it is not a right answer,

I apologize for the mistake. To get the position of a ZRender group, you can use the  position  property of the group. Here's an example of how you can use the  position  property to get the position of a group in ZRender: In this example, the position of the group is set to  [100, 200]  and can be retrieved using the  position  property.

I just want to get the group position in zrender, but your answer is not right
