Taxonomy of cloud service security refers to the categorization of security controls that are implemented in cloud services. It includes physical security, network security, application security, data security, and compliance and regulatory security. There are several authentication models in cloud computing, including password-based authentication, two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication, and biometric authentication. The comparison of these models is based on factors such as security, convenience, and cost. The challenges of IAM (Identity and Access Management) in cloud computing include managing identities and access across multiple cloud environments, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, integrating IAM with existing systems, and maintaining visibility and control over user access. i) IAM refers to the processes and technologies used to manage and secure user identities and access to IT resources. ii) Trust and boundaries of IAM refer to establishing trust between different systems and organizations while maintaining secure boundaries to prevent unauthorized access. iii) IAM architecture and practices refer to the design and implementation of IAM systems, including user provisioning, access management, authentication, and authorization. iv) Relevant IAM standards and protocols for cloud service include OAuth, OpenID Connect, SAML, and SCIM. MAC (Mandatory Access Control), DAC (Discretionary Access Control), RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) are access control models used in cloud computing. MAC is based on security levels and is mandatory, DAC is discretionary and controlled by the owner, RBAC is based on user roles, and ABAC is based on user attributes. The IAM lifecycle in cloud computing includes identification, authentication, authorization, provisioning, and de-provisioning. This process involves managing user identities and access to cloud services throughout their lifecycle, from initial onboarding to offboarding.
