design a circuit to play FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays

FizzBuzz is a well-known coding challenge where you have to print out the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, you print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, you print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, you print "FizzBuzz." To design a circuit that plays FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays, you would need to break down the problem into smaller components. Here\

What logic equation would you implement to determine if a number is a multiple of 3? Provide the simplest form using AND, OR, NOR, NOT, XOR or XNOR gates.
