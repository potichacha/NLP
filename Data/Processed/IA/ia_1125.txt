Explain how async JS programming is functional in nature.

Async JavaScript programming is functional in nature because it leverages higher-order functions, closures, and immutable data structures to manage asynchronous tasks and handle concurrency. Here's a breakdown of these functional programming concepts and how they relate to async JS: Higher-order functions: In functional programming, higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments, return functions, or both. JavaScript's async programming makes heavy use of higher-order functions in the form of callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. These higher-order functions help manage async operations by allowing you to pass in a function that will execute once the async operation has completed. Closures: A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. JavaScript closures are essential for async programming, as they allow you to maintain the state across async function calls. This is particularly useful in managing async operations, where state needs to be preserved between the start of an operation and its completion. Immutable data structures: Functional programming encourages the use of immutable data structures, meaning their state cannot be changed after creation. This helps to manage side effects and maintain predictability in the code. In async JavaScript programming, immutability can be helpful in preventing unexpected changes to data due to concurrent async operations. For example, using  const  instead of  let  or  var  can help ensure that variables remain immutable and are not inadvertently modified during the execution of async code. In summary, async JavaScript programming employs functional programming concepts such as higher-order functions, closures, and immutable data structures to manage asynchronous tasks and handle concurrency. These concepts help developers write more predictable, maintainable, and efficient code when dealing with asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
