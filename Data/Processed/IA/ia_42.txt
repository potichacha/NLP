1 / 2Write in typescript the code that integrates an ecommerce site that uses Salesforce commerce cloud Save & SubmitCancel

Here is an example of how you might integrate an ecommerce site that uses Salesforce Commerce Cloud with TypeScript: This code imports the Commerce Cloud SDK and initializes it with your client ID and client secret. It then authenticates with Commerce Cloud using a username and password, and creates a new client object that can be used to make API requests to Commerce Cloud. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
