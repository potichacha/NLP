I'm using `sqlc` with golang. For generated go function that update a database, do I have to specify every value in an update statement? If my table has 7 fields do I always have to provide information on all seven fields?

No, you don\

If I may want to update any number of fields from 1 to 7 do I have to write several sql update statements?

No, you don't have to write several SQL update statements to handle different combinations of fields to update. Instead, you can use a dynamic SQL query that builds the update statement based on the input values. In Go, you can use the  strings.Builder  or  bytes.Buffer  to construct a dynamic SQL query. For example, you can create a function that takes a struct representing the updated fields and generates an update statement based on which fields are non-zero: This function takes the table name, the ID of the row to update, and a struct representing the updated fields. It uses reflection to iterate over the fields of the struct and generates a set clause for each non-zero field. Finally, it returns the generated update statement and the arguments to pass to the  ExecContext  method. You can then use this function to generate the update statement and arguments in your  sqlc  query function: In this example, the generated  UpdateUser  function calls the  UpdateQuery  function to generate the update statement and arguments based on the  UserUpdate  struct. If there are no non-zero fields in the struct, the function returns immediately without executing the update.

In this case you are not using sqlc generated go functions. Is there a way to do this with sqlc generated functions?
