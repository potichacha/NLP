connect to 100 wallets and save them in the variable allWallets

This code uses a loop to create 100 HD wallets using the same mnemonic phrase and json rpc link ' ' and  ethers  library. Each iteration of the loop creates a new wallet by passing a different index to the  MnemonicWallet  class, which will generate a different address. Once all wallets are created, they are added to the  allWallets  array and are logged to the console. Please be sure to check the documentation of the service   before using it. It's worth noting that creating 100 wallets with the same mnemonic phrase is not considered safe, as the mnemonic phrase can be used to recover all the wallets. It is recommended to use different mnemonic phrases for each wallet.
