how to measure vnn on phasor diagram

VNN, or the line-to-line voltage of a three-phase power system, can be measured on a phasor diagram using the following steps: Draw a horizontal line to represent the reference line, or the zero-degree point on the phasor diagram. Draw three phasors to represent the three line-to-neutral voltages, each displaced from the reference line by 120 degrees. Label these phasors V1, V2, and V3. Draw a line connecting the tips of two adjacent phasors to represent the line-to-line voltage between those two phases. Label this line with the voltage value in volts. Repeat step 3 for the other two pairs of adjacent phases. Measure the length of any of the three line-to-line voltage lines to determine the magnitude of VNN. This value represents the voltage between any two of the three phases in the three-phase system. If you need to find
