{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure, here's an example of how you can create a  TabView  with multiple full screen  ScrollView s using  PageTabViewStyle : In this example, we're using a  TabView  to switch between different  ScrollView s, each containing some text rows. We use  ForEach  to create five different  ScrollView s, and each  ScrollView  contains a  VStack  with some  Text  rows. Note that we're using  .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)  on the  ScrollView  to make it full screen. Also, the  PageTabViewStyle()  modifier is applied to the  TabView  to make it look like a paginated scroll view. You can customize the contents of each  ScrollView  as per your requirements."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure! Here's an updated example that uses dynamic background colors for each  ScrollView  and transitions smoothly between colors as you switch between pages: In this updated example, we first define an array of colors that we will use for the backgrounds of each  ScrollView . We then use the  ForEach  loop to create a separate  ScrollView  for each color, and set the background color of each  ScrollView  to the corresponding color in the  colors  array. We also use the  .transition(.slide)  modifier to create a slide animation between colors when we switch between pages, and the  .animation(.default)  modifier to apply a default animation to the transition. Note that we're using  .background  to set the background color of each  ScrollView . We're also applying the  .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)  modifier to each  ScrollView  to make it full screen."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Got it! Here's an updated example that transitions the background color of the  TabView  smoothly as you switch between pages: In this updated example, we're using the  selection  binding to keep track of the currently selected page. We also define a  background  state variable to hold the current background color of the  TabView . We set the  tag  of each  ScrollView  to its index value so that it corresponds to the index value of the corresponding page in the  TabView . We use the  .onAppear  modifier to set the initial background color to the color of the first page. We then use the  .onChange  modifier to update the background color with the corresponding color from the  colors  array when the selection changes. We also
