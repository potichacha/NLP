how does CORS relate to web development? Meaning, as a developer, how does it affect my work?

CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a security feature implemented in web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one the web page originated from. As a web developer, CORS affects your work in several ways. For example, if you are building a web application that makes requests to a different domain than the one it was served from, you need to ensure that the server hosting the requested resource has CORS enabled. Otherwise, the browser will block the request, and your application will not be able to access the requested resource. To enable CORS, you need to configure the server hosting the requested resource to include the necessary response headers. These headers typically include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, which specifies which domains are allowed to access the resource. CORS also affects your work if you are building a web API that will be consumed by other websites or web applications. In this case, you need to ensure that your API is CORS-enabled and that the appropriate response headers are included in the API's responses. Overall, CORS is an important consideration for web developers when building applications that interact with resources on different domains. It is essential to understand how CORS works and how to enable it properly to avoid issues with cross-origin requests.
