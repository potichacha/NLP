What are their benefits over non-semantic elements? b. What is the difference between    a. Semantic elements in HTML are tags that give meaning to the content they enclose. Some examples of semantic elements are <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, and <figure>. Using semantic elements helps to structure the content in a way that makes it more understandable to both humans and machines, such as search engines. Sketching a webpage\'s layout using semantic elements would involve dividing the content into meaningful sections, such as the header, navigation, main content, sidebar, and footer. By using semantic elements, the layout of the webpage becomes more organized, making it easier to read and navigate. Benefits of using semantic elements over non-semantic elements include improved accessibility, better search engine optimization, and easier maintenance of the webpage. b. <section>, <article>, and <div> are all HTML elements used for structuring content on a webpage. The main difference between them is their semantic meaning. The <section> element is used to group related content, such as chapters or sections of an article. It can also be used to divide a webpage into different areas or sections, making it easier to navigate. The <article> element is used to define an independent, self-contained piece of content that can be distributed and reused independently. For example, a blog post, news article, or product review can be considered an article. The <div> element is a generic container element that is used to group elements together for styling or scripting purposes. It has no semantic meaning, so it should only be used when no other element is more appropriate. In general, you would use <section> to group related content, <article> to define an independent piece of content, and <div> to group elements together for styling or scripting purposes.
