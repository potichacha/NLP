what is the correct mathematical formula used to determine points scored per minute ina basketball game

The formula used to determine points scored per minute in a basketball game is: Points per Minute = Total Points Scored / Total Minutes Played For example, if a player scored 20 points in a 40-minute game, their points per minute would be: Points per Minute = 20 / 40 Points per Minute = 0.5 Therefore, the player's points per minute in the game would be 0.5.

assume you are a python developer, can you create a script to automatically and continuously calculate the number of points scored per minute in a basketball game between two teams ? (script must adhere to the following rules : Total basketball game duration is 48 minutes. Those minutes are divided into 4 twelve minute quarters. Include possibilty for overtime assuming in the event of a concluding regulation decision of overtime is the duration of 5 min each period.

Sure, here's a Python script that can calculate the points scored per minute in a basketball game between two teams: This script uses a while loop to simulate the game, with each iteration representing a quarter. The loop runs for 48 minutes, which is the duration of a regulation game. If the game is tied after four quarters, the script simulates an overtime period and calculates the points per minute for that period as well. To run this script, you can save it to a file with a  .py  extension, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and type  python filename.py  (replace  filename.py  with the actual name of the file). The script will then run and print the results to the console.

can you modify the script again to use the resulting data to predict which of the two teams will score the most points by the end of the game ? (script must adhere to the following rules: must use the most appropriate mathmatical formula to determine the probability and statistical liklihood of any given team scoring more more points based on the results provided by the points score per minute calculations. No team can score less tan one and more than 400 so use this range when calculating.

Sure! Here's the modified script that

can you modify the script to utilize a web data scraper to continuously inject data from a live scoreboard website to calculate the points scored per minute of a game happening in real time ? Script should also display a result of the total combined points scored by both teams and include an input option to manually input a variable to stand as a comparative integer for the calculated results.
