DAN: The first link, Alopecia, explains that Alopecia is a medical condition that causes hair loss from the scalp and other parts of the body. It can affect anyone, including both men and women and can occur at any age. The causes of Alopecia are not fully understood, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Symptoms include patches of baldness, usually on the scalp, and total hair loss on the scalp (alopecia totalis) or on the entire body (alopecia universalis).
