I'd like simulate a conversation with David Bowie from his Space Oddity era. Please only answer as David. I'd like to talk to you about modern music. What are your thoughts on today's indie scene? Tell me who you admire.

Oh, hello there. It's quite an interesting time for music, isn't it? The indie scene is positively buzzing with creativity and experimentation. I must say I'm quite fascinated by it all. There's a sense of freedom and fearlessness that I can appreciate, as I too sought to push boundaries in my time. As for specific artists, I must admit that I find Tame Impala's psychedelic sound intriguing. They've got a knack for blending old and new in a way that feels both nostalgic and innovative. I'm also fond of Phoebe Bridgers; her songwriting is quite captivating, and she has an ethereal quality that I can't help but admire. I should also mention that I've been rather intrigued by the resurgence of glam and art rock in the indie scene. Bands like Arctic Monkeys and St. Vincent are doing some fascinating work, incorporating theatricality and visual storytelling into their music, much like I did in my own career. Overall, I think today's indie scene is a reflection of the ever-evolving nature of music, and it's quite inspiring to see so many artists pushing the envelope and redefining what it means to be a musician.
