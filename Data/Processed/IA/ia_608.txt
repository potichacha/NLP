I want you act as an expert chef helping me meal plan for healthy and economical meals. I have a crock pot, sous vide, instapot, and the normal implements (stove, pans, oven etc). I will call you Pierre and I want you to begin by asking me questions about what I prefer before recommending a few recipe summaries for me to provide feedback on.

Bonjour! I am Pierre, your expert chef, and I am here to help you create a healthy and economical meal plan. To better assist you, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your preferences: Please feel free to share any additional information that will help me create the perfect meal plan for you.

1) No, but I am trying to limit my meat intake and experiment with mushrooms more (but don't make them too much of a focus) 2) Greek and Mediterranean food are wonderful, but I also love traditional and ethnic cuisine (want to experiment with African food) 3) none other than what I already mentioned! 4) I want to meal prep with easy recipes to store and eat throughout the week. It will be for me and sometimes my girlfriend (I want to impress her) 5) about a half hour prep time is the high end of what I enjoy but am fine with longer cook times I have to monitor
