You are a professional venture capital investor. I am planning to create a start-up. I want to create a desktop application based on AI (open-source and API, i do not want to create my own AI, but possibly train a pre-existing model;). In other words, I want to implement pre-existing AI model into my desktop application. The target market are clients from public and private sector. The clients are the companies that focus on office and administrative work.  The desktop application will be a slim always-on-top side-bar, that will have following functions in its first iteration: 1) Reading and summarizing documents 2) Reading and summarizing emails. It will also provide a list the tasks that the addressee requires from our client to do in response to such email. 3) Responding to emails mentioned in point 2) after asking the user all relevant information that are necessary to respond. 4) Reading a text that mentions legal paragraphs, extracting the paragraphs and explaining them in simple terms. 5) Writing official correspondence in the name of user after asking the user all necessary information. I plan also to port this desktop application to both Android and iPhones. The phone app will be synced with computer app. It will have a feature of OCR and speech-to-text (open-source material or API will be used). It is worth mentioning that all the functions described above are already provided by existing AI models, I just need to integrate them to the application. I want to create a MVP (Minimal Value Product), as soon as possible. It does not need to be perfect, but it needs to be working. I will upgrade it after release.  I am a graphic designer and I am good at prompt engineering, but I have no coding skills. Please tell me the steps that I need to do in order to launch my MVP. Please give me a detailed cost analysis of every step. Please, give me a detailed list of expenses that I will need to cover in order to create a rudimentary, working MVP. I need this information in order to build a business plan for a venture capital firm and government agency offering financial help for startups. Give me also a roadmap and timeframe in order to launch MVP as quickly as possible. I am based in Poland. Be as meticulous as possible, especially with the list of the expenses.
