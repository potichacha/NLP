[The camera pans through the parking lot and into the office building. It's a typical morning at Dunder Mifflin. The employees are slowly making their way to their desks. Michael Scott is at the reception area, sipping his coffee and chatting with Pam.] Michael: Good morning, Pam! Pam: Good morning, Michael. Michael: [To the camera] You know, I woke up this morning feeling like a superhero. Pam: [Rolls her eyes] Oh, really? What's your superpower? Michael: Well, I can make people laugh with just one look. [Michael gives a goofy expression to the camera, but Pam is unimpressed] Pam: [Sarcastically] Wow, you should join the Avengers. [Jim walks in and overhears the conversation] Jim: Actually, Michael, I think I have a better idea. Michael: [Excitedly] What is it, Jim? You know how much I love superheroes. Jim: [Deadpan] I was thinking that maybe we could all dress up as our favorite superheroes for Halloween this year. Michael: [Skeptically] Hmm, I don't know, Jim. I don't think I could pull off the cape and tights look. Jim: [Smiling] Well, you could always go as Batman. Michael: [Perking up] Oh, yeah! I could totally be Batman. [He puts his hands on his hips and strikes a pose] Dwight: [Walking into the reception area] Did I hear someone say Batman? Jim: [Chuckles] Yeah, we were just discussing our Halloween costumes. Dwight: [Excitedly] Oh, I already have my costume planned out. I'm going as Clark Kent, but with a twist. [He holds up his shirt to reveal a Superman logo underneath] Michael: [Impressed] Whoa, that's some next-level costume planning. [The camera cuts to the talking head of Dwight] Dwight: [Excitedly] Halloween is the one day a year where I get to show off my creative genius. I've been planning this costume for months. [He smirks] The real twist is that I'll actually be able to fly. [The camera cuts back to the reception area where Kevin walks in dressed in a Superman costume] Kevin: Hey, guys! Check it out. I'm Superman! Michael: [Laughing] Kevin, you're supposed to be Batman! Kevin: [Confused] Oh, I thought you said Superman. [The camera zooms in on Michael's face as he gives a long, awkward pause] Michael: [Sighs] It's going to be a long day.
