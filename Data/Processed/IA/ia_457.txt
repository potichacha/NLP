here are the columns we have in the data: fruit_label,fruit_name,fruit_subtype,mass,width,height,color_score how do we fix this code: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(fruit_data.drop('label', axis=1), fruit_data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

Assuming that the 'fruit_label' column is the column that you want to use as the label for the classification problem, you should replace the 'label' argument in the code with 'fruit_label'. Here is the updated code: This code drops the 'fruit_label' column from the feature data using the drop() method and passes the resulting data to X_train and X_test. The 'fruit_label' column is used as the target variable and passed to y_train and y_test. This should split the data into training and testing sets for a classification problem with 'fruit_label' as the target variable.

fix this: /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pandas/core/indexes/base.py in drop(self, labels, errors)  6659 if mask.any():  6660 if errors != "ignore": -> 6661 raise KeyError(f"{list(labels[mask])} not found in axis")  6662 indexer = indexer[~mask]  6663 return self.delete(indexer) KeyError: "[\
