Zhekar was born in a small village in the outskirts of a war-torn country. His family was poor, and he had to work hard to make ends meet. However, Zhekar was a bright young man with a strong sense of duty and honor. When he turned 18, he decided to join the military to fight for his country. Zhekar's natural leadership skills and bravery quickly caught the attention of his superiors, and he was promoted to the rank of captain. Zhekar was in charge of a small unit that was responsible for carrying out covert missions behind enemy lines. Although Zhekar was a skilled warrior, he found the sight of the dead bodies of his enemies and his comrades difficult to bear. After serving in the military for several years, Zhekar left the army and returned to his village. He was haunted by the memories of the war and struggled to adjust to civilian life. Zhekar's wife, Shemira, and son, Daimon, were the only people who could bring him peace. However, tragedy struck when both his wife and son died due to an epidemic. In his despair, Zhekar turned to religion and became a devout follower of Kelemvor, the god of the dead. Zhekar hoped to find solace in serving Kelemvor and helping the souls of the dead find peace. However, Zhekar's faith was shattered when he realized that Kelemvor's teachings didn't address the undead, who were often treated as evil and monstrous creatures. Zhekar eventually became an oathbreaker and turned to a new god, Altzmyr, who believed that the undead were creatures too and deserved to be treated with respect. Zhekar's main goal became to show the world that undead were people too and that not all undead were evil. He left his village and traveled across the sea in search of a way to help the undead and prove his point. Zhekar's journey is one of self-discovery and redemption. He hopes to find a way to help the undead and make up for the mistakes he made in the past. Zhekar's experiences in the military have given him the skills and knowledge he needs to navigate dangerous situations and help those in need. However, Zhekar is also haunted by his past and struggles with the memories of his loved ones.
