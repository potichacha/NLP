build a minimal c++ IMGUI application that uses sfml and works on windows, linux, mac os, android and ios

Here's an example of a minimal C++ IMGUI application that uses SFML and can run on Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and iOS. Note that this example code assumes that you have already set up SFML and IMGUI on your system. To compile this code on each platform, you will need to link against the appropriate SFML libraries and include headers for any additional platform-specific code (such as Android or iOS). Additionally, you may need to make some modifications to the code to handle any platform-specific quirks.

create the cmake file that will make the application work on all platforms mentioned above

Here's an example CMakeLists.txt file that can be used to build the IMGUI application using SFML on all the platforms mentioned: This CMakeLists.txt file assumes that the IMGUI and ImGui-SFML libraries have been placed in the imgui and imgui-sfml directories, respectively, within the project directory. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the include directories accordingly. To build the project, you can run the following commands from the project directory: This will create a build directory, generate the build files, and compile the project into an executable. The resulting executable should be able to run on all the platforms mentioned, assuming that the necessary SFML libraries and dependencies have been installed.

use the FetchContent in cmake to automatically download and build sfml

Sure! Here's an example CMakeLists.txt file that uses  FetchContent  to download and build SFML automatically: With this CMakeLists.txt file, the  FetchContent_Declare  function downloads the SFML repository from GitHub and checks out the  master  branch. Then, the  FetchContent_MakeAvailable  function automatically builds and installs SFML as a dependency of the project. Note that this may take some time to download and build. After running  cmake  and  cmake --build , the resulting executable should be able to run on all the platforms mentioned.

update the cmake file so that sfml is linked statically
