in python 3 if I catch an exception and then raise it will the original stack trace show up? Can you demonstrate with sample code?

No, if you catch an exception and then raise it again in Python 3, the original stack trace will not be preserved by default. The new stack trace will start from the point where the exception was re-raised. However, you can use the  raise  statement with no arguments to re-raise the original exception and preserve the original stack trace. Here's an example: In this example, we define a function  function_that_raises()  that raises a  ValueError . We then call this function inside a  try  block and catch the  ValueError  exception that it raises. Inside the  except  block, we print a message indicating that we caught the exception and then re-raise it using the  raise  statement with no arguments. This will preserve the original stack trace. Here's an example of the output you might see: As you can see, the original stack trace is preserved and shows the line where the exception was originally raised.
