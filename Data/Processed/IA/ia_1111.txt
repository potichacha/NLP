i have an image in /secureimages/abc.png i want to serve this image as http://localhost/images/logo.png How can i do this using nestjs and typescript

To serve an image from a specific location as a static file in NestJS, you can use the  ServeStaticModule  provided by NestJS. Here are the steps to follow: In the above code, we're serving files from the  secureimages  folder, and mapping them to the  /images  URL prefix. This means that if you have an image called  abc.png  in the  secureimages  folder, it will be accessible at  http://localhost/images/abc.png . Now you can access the image at the URL  http://localhost/images/logo.png , assuming that  logo.png  exists in the  /secureimages  directory. That's it! Your image should now be accessible at the URL you specified.

but the name of the image is abc.png and i would like to serve it as logo.png

To serve an image with a different name than its original file name, you can use the  serveStatic()  method provided by NestJS to create a custom route. Here's an example: In the above code, we're creating a route that maps the URL  /images/logo.png  to the file  abc.png  in the  secureimages  folder. When a request is made to this URL, the  serveLogo()  method will be called, which sends the file as a response using the  res.sendFile()  method. In your NestJS module, import the  ImageController : That's it! Your image should now be accessible at the URL you specified, with the file name you want it to have.

To serve an image with a different name than its original file name, the names will be dynamic

To serve dynamic images with custom names, you can use route parameters in your NestJS controller. Here's an example: In the above code, we're creating a dynamic route that maps the URL  /images/:imageName  to a file in the  secureimages  folder with the same name as the route parameter  imageName . When a request is made to this URL, the  serveImage()  method will be called, which sends the file as a response using the  res.sendFile()  method. In your NestJS module, import the  ImageController : That's it! Your dynamic images should now be accessible at the URLs you specified, with the file names based on the route parameters.
