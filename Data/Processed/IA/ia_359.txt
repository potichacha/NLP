I am an owner of a condominium unit in Singapore. There is a water fountain below my unit that generates a lot of noise. After many attempts talking to the management, they refuse to make any adjustment. I am thinking of going through legal route. What's your recommendation?

I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general suggestions based on your situation. If you're considering a legal route, it's best to consult with a qualified attorney familiar with Singaporean law and condominium regulations. Here are a few steps you might consider: Document the issue: Keep a record of the noise problem, including dates, times, and durations. You may also want to collect audio or video evidence to support your claim. Keep a record of all correspondence with the management. Consult the condominium by-laws: Review the condominium by-laws and management agreements to determine if there are any noise-related provisions or restrictions that may apply to your situation. Seek legal advice: Consult with a lawyer who is experienced in Singaporean property law. They can help you understand your rights, the potential remedies available, and the best course of action. Engage in mediation: Before resorting to a lawsuit, consider using mediation or alternative dispute resolution methods to resolve the issue amicably. This approach is generally less time-consuming and less expensive than going to court. Legal action: If mediation fails, your lawyer may recommend pursuing a legal action against the management or the condominium corporation. This could involve seeking an injunction or damages for the noise disturbance. Be aware that legal action can be time-consuming and expensive, and there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome. Remember that it's essential to consult with a qualified attorney to ensure you receive accurate and relevant advice for your specific situation.
