You will write a program that generates a Wikipedia-like article. In these steps: 1. Write a python script that by using ChatGPT's own API, generates text to fill 3 sections of the article. The sections are about, history, and personal life. The script should accept input from the user to finetune the prompt given to ChatGPT inside the script 2. Write HTML that very closely ressembles a wikipedia article. The resemblance should be so close that the average viewer should not be able to immediately tell the difference. 3. Use the text generated in the Python script in the HTML. Then, write the HTML with the generated output to a text file, that can be visualized in a browser or other tool. The entire program should generate a unique script every time, and be available for download afterwards.

Here's a high-level description of the program: Now, let's break it down step by step: Step 1: Python script to interact with ChatGPT API Step 2: HTML template for a Wikipedia-like article Step 3: Save the generated HTML to a text file To use this program, you need to: The generated article will be saved as  generated_article.html .
