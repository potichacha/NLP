As a life coach, provide me with a detailed routine to help me achieve my goals for the next month, taking into account my background and preferences in the following areas: Background context: I am a 30-year-old male with a sedentary job. I have some experience with weightlifting and moderate cardio exercises, but I haven't been consistent with my workouts for the past year. I prefer plant-based meals and have a slight lactose intolerance. My goal is to lose 10 kg to improve my health and overall wellbeing. In terms of learning linear algebra, I have a solid foundation in high school mathematics, including algebra and basic calculus. My goal is to learn linear algebra for personal enrichment and to potentially pursue higher education in a STEM field. I am a visual learner and prefer a combination of lectures, practice problems, and interactive resources for learning. Goals and detailed routine: Weight Loss (10 kg): Allocate a maximum of 1.5 hours per day. 1.1. Considering my workout history and food preferences, provide a daily workout and plant-based diet plan that accommodates my lactose intolerance and helps me reach my weight loss objective. Learn Linear Algebra: Allocate a maximum of 1 hour per day. 2.1. Given my prior knowledge of math, learning style, and goals for learning linear algebra, provide a daily study plan with a combination of visual lectures, practice problems, and interactive resources, including detailed homework assignments for each day.

Goals and detailed routine: Weight Loss (10 kg): Allocate a maximum of 1.5 hours per day. 1.1. Daily Workout Plan: To achieve your weight loss goal, you'll focus on a combination of weightlifting and cardio exercises. Follow this workout routine 5 days a week, leaving 2 days for rest or lighter activities like yoga or walking. Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Weightlifting and Cardio (1.5 hours) Tuesday and Thursday: Cardio and Bodyweight Exercises (1.5 hours) 1.2. Daily Plant-Based Diet Plan: To support your weight loss and workout goals, aim for a balanced diet with a caloric deficit of around 500 calories per day. Focus on whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Ensure you're getting enough protein and healthy fats. Breakfast: Lunch: Dinner: Snacks: Learn Linear Algebra: Allocate a maximum of 1 hour per day. 2.1. Daily Study Plan: To learn linear algebra effectively, follow this study plan 5 days a week, leaving 2 days for rest or review. Use resources like Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, and 3Blue1Brown for visual lectures and practice problems. Week 1: Week 2:

Write me a good explainer targeted for the layperson learner about the concept of linear independence, and using a lot of real-world analogies.
