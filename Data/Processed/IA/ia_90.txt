what is a google open source javascript library to create and edit articles in a laravel based website like the one you described above

One popular JavaScript library for creating and editing articles in a Laravel-based website is called CKEditor. CKEditor is a open source, full-featured WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) rich text editor that can be easily integrated into a Laravel-based website. It provides a variety of tools for formatting text, inserting images, and adding links, as well as other features such as spell check and undo/redo functionality. To use CKEditor in your Laravel-based website, you will need to first download and install the library. There are several ways to do this, including installing it via npm or downloading the library files directly from the CKEditor website. Once the library is installed, you can then include the CKEditor script in your Laravel project and use it to create and edit articles. There are also other JavaScript libraries that you can use for creating and editing articles in a Laravel-based website, such as TinyMCE and Quill. Each of these libraries has its own set of features and may be more or less suitable for your specific needs.
