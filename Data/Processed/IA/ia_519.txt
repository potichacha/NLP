Can you describe what the following HTML+JS does? ``` infinite haikupotamus ```

This HTML and JavaScript code creates a web page that displays an interactive haiku. The main components of the code are: HTML structure: The HTML sets the page title, specifies viewport settings for mobile devices, imports the EB Garamond font from Google Fonts, and defines the styles for the page. CSS styles: The CSS defines the appearance of the page, including the background color, font styles, and animations/transitions for the haiku text. JavaScript: The JavaScript code includes two main classes,  Haiku  and  HaikuController , which handle the creation, display, and interaction with the haikus. sanitize_word(word) : This function takes a word as input and returns the word in lowercase with all non-alphanumeric characters removed. Haiku : This class represents a single haiku. It creates an HTML structure for the haiku, handles click events on words, and animates the haiku\

Can you suggest any improvements or fixes to the code?
