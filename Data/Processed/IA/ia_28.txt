Teach me how to analyze DNA data in Python. I don't know a whole lot, so you'll need to walk me through the code and the science.

ok now show me some code

How could I automatically detect likely mutation sites?

ok cool, do that in the code

show me how the output might look

how should I interpret that?

So, specifically, what does the output you showed me mean? The part where it talks about sequences producing significant alignments

so that lets us match up a sequence fragment with where it likely came from?

It looks like it searches across the genomes of multiple species. I can guess what BOVIN and HUMAN correspond to, but what is GORGO?

Oh makes sense. Is there a database where I can match up genes with e.g. predisposition to a particular disease (like a type of cancer or MS)

Is there a way of accessing it programmatically?

Show me how

show me a cample output

Does it also return the DNA sequence of the gene?
