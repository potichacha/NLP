In oracle pl/sql for oracle ebs how do I call the fnd_user_pkg.isuseractive function?

To call the  FND_USER_PKG.ISUSERACTIVE  function in Oracle PL/SQL for Oracle EBS, you can follow these steps: Open a new PL/SQL block or add the code to an existing block. Declare a variable to hold the user name whose activity status you want to check. For example, you can use the following code to declare a variable named  p_user_name : Call the  FND_USER_PKG.ISUSERACTIVE  function using the  p_user_name  variable as the input parameter. The function returns a Boolean value indicating whether the user is active or not. For example, you can use the following code to call the function: In this example, the  p_is_active  variable is used to store the return value of the  FND_USER_PKG.ISUSERACTIVE  function, and the  IF  statement checks whether the user is active or not based on the value of  p_is_active . The  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE  procedure is used to print the result to the console. Replace  USER_NAME_HERE  with the actual user name you want to check, and then execute the PL/SQL block to call the function and display the result.

Thank you so much! How do I call the same isuseractive method with the 2nd parameter of p_status_out

To call the  FND_USER_PKG.ISUSERACTIVE  function with the  p_status_out  parameter, you can modify the code as follows: In this modified code, the  p_status_out  parameter is declared as a  VARCHAR2  variable to store the output status value of the  FND_USER_PKG.ISUSERACTIVE  function. The function call includes both  p_user_name  and  p_status_out  parameters. After the function call, the code checks the value of  p_is_active  as before, but now also prints the output value of  p_status_out  to the console using  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE . Replace  USER_NAME_HERE  with the actual user name you want to check, and then execute the PL/SQL block to call the function and display the results.

I'm sorry. p_status_out is actually x_status and it is a number. How do I make the call with x_status being the out variable?
