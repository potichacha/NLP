Explain different gray level techniques with diagrams?

Gray level techniques are used in image processing to manipulate the intensity levels of gray-scale images. These techniques can be used to enhance images, extract features, or segment images. Here are some of the common gray level techniques with diagrams: Original Image: Negated Image: Original Image: Thresholded Image: Original Image: Contrast Stretched Image: Original Image: Equalized Image: These are just a few examples of the many gray level techniques used in image processing. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of technique will depend on the specific application and desired outcome.

Explain different linear filters?

Linear filters are used in image processing to perform operations on an image, such as blurring or sharpening, by applying a mathematical function to each pixel in the image. Here are some of the common linear filters: These are just a few examples of the many linear filters used in image processing. Each filter has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of filter will depend on the specific application and desired outcome.
