{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Pubmed is a well-known and reputable online database that indexes biomedical literature. The provided search results show three different research articles available on Pubmed. The first article [ ] discusses surgical site infections, which affect approximately 0.5% to 3% of patients undergoing surgery. These infections can lead to longer hospital stays and are associated with increased healthcare costs. The article suggests avoiding razors for hair removal, maintaining normothermia, using chlorhexidine gluconate plus alcohol-based skin preps, and administering prophylactic antibiotics as potential measures to prevent surgical site infections. The second article [ ] focuses on seasonal influenza virus circulation, which declined in 2020-21 after SARS-CoV-2 emerged, but increased in 2021-22. Most people with influenza experience respiratory symptoms and myalgia, recover within 1 week, and may not require medical treatment. However, some individuals can experience severe or fatal complications. The article emphasizes that prevention of influenza is primarily through annual influenza vaccinations. The third article [ ] examines the impact of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related outcomes. The study is a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, which suggests that vitamin D supplementation may have a protective effect against COVID-19, particularly in individuals who are deficient in vitamin D.
