Advertising: Display ads in the game to earn revenue on a cost-per-impression or cost-per-click basis. Freemium model: Offer a free version of the game with in-app purchases or ads, and a premium version with additional features for a fee. Subscription model: Charge a monthly or yearly fee for access to the game's content and features.

Too many ads or intrusive in-app purchases can drive users away, while not monetizing enough can limit the potential revenue of the game."}
