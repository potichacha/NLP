example zabbix_sender command for importing data from a csv file, zabbix version 6.0.8

Assuming you want to import data from a CSV file into Zabbix 6.0.8 using the  zabbix_sender  command, you can use the following format: Here's what each of the parameters mean: Assuming your CSV file has two columns, one for item key and one for value, you can use a loop to read the file line by line and run the  zabbix_sender  command for each line. Here's an example in Bash: In this example, we use  tail -n +2  to skip the first line of the CSV file, which is assumed to be the header row. The  read  command reads each line of the CSV file into the  key  and  value  variables, and the  zabbix_sender  command is run with the appropriate parameters for each line.
