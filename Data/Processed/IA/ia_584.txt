please make me an intermediate running calendar from today until 4/15/23 to run a half-marathon on that date

I've created an intermediate running calendar for you to prepare for your half-marathon on April 15, 2023. This plan assumes that you have a solid running base and can comfortably run at least 15-20 miles per week. The schedule includes easy runs, long runs, rest days, and some speed work to help you improve your overall fitness and endurance. Please note that this is a general plan and may need to be adjusted based on your individual needs and progress. Week 1 (March 26 - April 1): M: 3 miles easy T: 4 miles with 4 x 800m at 10K pace, 400m recovery jog between intervals W: 4 miles easy Th: 5 miles at a moderate pace F: Rest S: 8 miles easy Su: Rest Week 2 (April 2 - April 8): M: 4 miles easy T: 5 miles with 1 mile warm-up, 3 miles at half-marathon pace, 1 mile cool-down W: 4 miles easy Th: 6 miles at a moderate pace F: Rest S: 10 miles easy Su: Rest Week 3 (April 9 - April 15): M: 4 miles easy T: 6 miles with 1 mile warm-up, 4 x 1 mile at 10K pace, 1 mile cool-down (400m recovery jog between intervals) W: 5 miles easy Th: 3 miles easy F: Rest S: 2 miles easy Su: Half-Marathon (13.1 miles) Tips for success: Remember to consult with a healthcare professional or running coach before beginning any new exercise program, especially if you have any pre-existing health conditions or concerns. Good luck with your half-marathon training!
