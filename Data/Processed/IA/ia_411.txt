I'm using an esp32c3 board on an ubuntu server, can you show me how i can flash an ELF file onto the board?

Certainly, here are the steps to flash an ELF file onto an ESP32-C3 board using an Ubuntu server: Connect the ESP32-C3 board to your Ubuntu server via USB cable. Install the necessary tools and packages for flashing the board. You can install these packages using the following command: Navigate to the directory where your ELF file is located. Open a terminal window and enter the following command to erase the ESP32-C3 board: This will erase the entire flash memory of the board. Next, flash the ELF file to the board using the following command: Replace  /dev/ttyUSB0  with the serial port that your board is connected to. Also, replace  your_elf_file.elf  with the name of your ELF file. Wait for the flashing process to complete. This may take a few minutes. Once the flashing process is complete, reset the board by pressing the reset button or by disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable. That's it! Your ESP32-C3 board should now be running the program from your ELF file.

what if i don't i have the source code for the ELF file? How can i compile it without the source?
