What is the best practice when consuming messages from Azure Queue Storage?

The best practice when consuming messages from Azure Queue Storage is to use a message-processing strategy that is both efficient and reliable. One common approach is to use a worker role in Azure Cloud Services or an Azure Functions app to process messages as they are added to the queue. This worker should be designed to handle message processing failures by implementing retries, dead-letter queues, and other error-handling mechanisms. Additionally, it's a good idea to use a lease-based message-processing strategy, which allows the worker to claim a message and process it exclusively, while also providing a mechanism for handling message-processing timeouts and releasing messages that are taking too long to process.

What are dead-letters in Azure Queue Storage?

In Azure Queue Storage, a dead-letter queue is a secondary queue that can be used to hold messages that cannot be successfully processed by the primary queue. These messages, also known as "dead-letter messages," can be moved to the dead-letter queue for further analysis and troubleshooting, or for manual intervention to resolve the issues that caused them to fail processing. When a message is moved to a dead-letter queue, it is typically accompanied by metadata that describes the reason for the failure and other relevant information that can be used to diagnose and resolve the issue. This can include information such as the number of times the message has been dequeued, the time of the last dequeue attempt, and any error messages or exception details that were generated during processing. Using dead-letter queue can be a good way to handle exception cases, like when there is an issue with a message or a service that is required to process the message, and it allows to separate the problematic messages from the normal ones and investigate them separately.

Are dead-letter queues implemented by default in Azure Queue Storage or do I need to implement such a feature myself?
