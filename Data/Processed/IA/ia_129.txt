{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'You can use the  Web.GetUserById  method to retrieve the user object for the client ID, and then set the  Title  property of the user object to the custom name you want to display. Here is an example of how you could update the code you provided to use a custom name: This will set the "Author" and "Editor" fields of the file to the user object with the custom name you specified.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'In order to keep the app as the file author/creator, but show the activity log as modified by another user\'s email, you can use the  EnsureUser  method to ensure that the other user exists in the SharePoint site collection, and then set the  Editor  property of the file to the other user. Here\'s an example of how you could update the code you provided to achieve this: This will set the "Editor" field of the file to the other user\'s email address, so that the activity log will show that user as the last person to modify the file, while the "Author" field of the file will still be set to the app. Also, you can use the  SystemUpdate  method to update the item and keep the created by and created date, This will update the item, but it will keep the original created by and created date.'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'How can I stop it from changing the modified/editor name of all previous uploaded files also?'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To prevent the modification of the "Editor" field from affecting the previously uploaded files, you need to make sure that you only modify the "Editor" field for the specific file that you are currently uploading, and not for all files in the SharePoint library. To achieve this, you need to make sure that you are only calling the  Update  method on the specific file object that you are currently uploading, and not on the entire SharePoint library. Here is an example of how you could update your code to achieve this: This will only update the "Editor" field for the specific file that you are currently uploading, and not for all files in the SharePoint library. Alternatively, you could query the library to find the specific file you want to update and set the editor field only for that file. This way you are querying the library for the specific file you want to update and then updating only that file.'}
