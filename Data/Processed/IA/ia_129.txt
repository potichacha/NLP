Write a high-scoring IELTS Band 9 essay on: Some people think that using mobile phones and computers has a negative effect on young people's reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

In today's digital age, the use of mobile phones and computers is increasingly ubiquitous among young people, leading to the argument that these devices are having a negative impact on their reading and writing skills. While there is some truth to this notion, I believe that the overall impact is more complex and depends on how these devices are used. On the one hand, there is evidence that spending too much time on mobile phones and computers can lead to a decline in young people's reading and writing abilities. For example, research has shown that heavy screen time can cause a decrease in attention span, making it more difficult for young people to focus on written content for an extended period. Additionally, the instant gratification offered by social media can lead to an over-reliance on short-form writing, such as text messages or tweets, rather than engaging in more substantial writing tasks. On the other hand, it is also possible to argue that mobile phones and computers can have a positive impact on young people's reading and writing skills. For instance, the availability of digital resources such as e-books, articles, and educational websites can provide young people with a wealth of information and knowledge at their fingertips. Furthermore, the ease of communication through instant messaging and social media platforms can encourage young people to engage in regular writing practices and develop their writing skills in a more informal setting. In conclusion, while there is some evidence that the excessive use of mobile phones and computers can have a negative effect on young people's reading and writing skills, the overall impact is more complex and depends on how these devices are used. By utilizing these tools in a responsible and balanced manner, young people can benefit from the opportunities they provide for learning and communication.
