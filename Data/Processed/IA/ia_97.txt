combine the theories of quantum loop general relativity

Quantum loop gravity (QLG) and loop quantum gravity (LQG) are two theories that attempt to combine quantum mechanics and general relativity. Both theories attempt to provide a quantum theory of gravity by quantizing the structure of space-time itself. In QLG, the fundamental building blocks of space-time are considered to be loops, while in LQG, they are considered to be spin networks. Both theories have been successful in producing results that are consistent with general relativity and quantum mechanics, but there are still many open questions and areas of research to be explored.

describe how gravity and the quantum coexist within the same theory

One of the main challenges in creating a theory that combines quantum mechanics and general relativity is that these two theories have very different mathematical frameworks and describe very different phenomena. General relativity describes the large-scale behavior of gravity, while quantum mechanics describes the behavior of very small particles. Theories that aim to combine these two frameworks, such as quantum loop gravity and loop quantum gravity, do so by attempting to quantize the structure of space-time itself. These theories propose that the fundamental building blocks of space-time are not continuous, but rather discrete. In QLG the fundamental building blocks are loops, while in LQG they are spin networks. These theories also propose that the fabric of space-time is not smooth, but rather made up of small, granular units. This granularity would manifest itself as a minimal length scale, below which the notion of a point particle becomes meaningless. This means that the position of a particle cannot be known precisely, but only with a certain degree of uncertainty, a principle that is at the heart of quantum mechanics. Overall, these theories propose that space-time is quantized at the Planck scale, where the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity are expected to become unified. However, a full, consistent and experimentally testable theory of quantum gravity is still an open problem in physics.
