I want to run puppetier on ec2 instance (linux), can this be done and what are the dependencies I need to install for this?

Yes, you can run Puppeteer on an Amazon EC2 instance with Linux. To get started, you'll need to set up your EC2 instance and install the necessary dependencies. Below are the steps to run Puppeteer on an Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance: Launch an Amazon Linux 2 instance from the AWS Management Console. Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH. Update the package list and install basic development tools: This will launch a headless Chrome browser, navigate to  https://example.com , take a screenshot, and save it as  example.png  in your project directory. Remember to adjust your script according to your use case and ensure that the instance's security group settings allow necessary access (e.g., outbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic).
