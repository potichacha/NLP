Can you write it without using the Macro?

Unfortunately, Excel does not have a built-in function to parse HTML content directly without using VBA or macros. However, you can try using a workaround with the WEBSERVICE and FILTERXML functions, although this method might not be as robust. In Excel, let's say you want to display the result in cell B2, and the column ID is in cell A2. In cell B2, enter the following formula: This formula uses the WEBSERVICE function to fetch the HTML content from the specified URL, and then FILTERXML function attempts to extract the content of the first <span> tag. However, please note that this method may not work reliably in all cases, as the FILTERXML function is designed to work with well-formed XML documents, and HTML content might not be well-formed XML. If the HTML content is not well-formed, you may encounter errors or incorrect results. In cases where this method does not work, you may need to use a custom VBA function or consider using other tools like Power Query, which provides more advanced web scraping capabilities.

I've saved it as an .xlsm and done all the above, but the formula isn't working, it just displays the formula but isn't running.
