convert json from file to a byte array

To convert JSON data from a file to a byte array, you can use the following Python code: In the above code, we first read the JSON data from a file named "data.json" using the  json.load()  method. Then, we convert the JSON data to bytes using the  bytes()  method and specifying the encoding as  utf-8 . The resulting byte array  json_bytes  can be used as needed in your program.

Expected one of the following `[typing.List[str]]` but got `` instead.

This error occurs because the type hint specified in the function signature is expecting a  List  of  str , but the value passed as an argument is a regular Python  list  object. To resolve this error, you can either change the type hint in the function signature to accept a regular  list  instead of a  List  or modify the argument passed to the function to be a  List  of  str . Here's an example of how you could modify the function to accept a regular  list : And here's an example of how you could modify the argument passed to the function to be a  List  of  str : By wrapping the  my_list  variable with  List[str]  constructor, we are converting the regular  list  to a  List  of  str , which matches the expected type hint of the  my_function  function.
