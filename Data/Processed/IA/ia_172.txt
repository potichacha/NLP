Consider the following scenario: CO2 sensor is interfaced with a MCU which sends data every 1 second to AWS IoT Core. The goal is to store the hash of the sensor data on a blokchain network for sensor data audit. Do a detail architecture for this keeping in mind that we would use Amazon Managed Blockchain solution and AWS Timestream as the database for sensor data

Here is a possible architecture for the scenario you described: The CO2 sensor is connected to a microcontroller unit (MCU) which is responsible for collecting and formatting the sensor data. The MCU sends the sensor data to AWS IoT Core every 1 second through MQTT or HTTP protocol. AWS IoT Core receives the sensor data and triggers a Lambda function which is responsible for: a. Hashing the sensor data using a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256 b. Storing the hashed data in an Amazon Timestream database. The Lambda function also triggers another function that will send the data to Amazon Managed Blockchain. Amazon Managed Blockchain receives the data and stores the hash in a blockchain network. This network can be a private Ethereum network or Hyperledger Fabric network, depending on your requirements. To ensure the integrity of the sensor data, the hash stored on the blockchain can be compared with the hash of the sensor data stored in the Timestream database. Finally, The hash can be used to verify the authenticity of the sensor data and ensure that it has not been tampered with. Note: This is a high-level architecture and it can be further optimized depending on your use case. Also, you may need to consider security measures such as encryption and authentication while sending and storing the data.

I want to use the Hyperledger fabric network. Explain in detail how to store the hash in the Hyperledger fabric network so that it is tamper proof
