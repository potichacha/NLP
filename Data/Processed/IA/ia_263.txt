what is lumbago?

Lumbago, also known as lower back pain, is a common condition that affects the lower part of the back. It can range from a dull ache to a sharp stabbing pain, and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as muscle strain, herniated discs, or arthritis. Lumbago can be acute, meaning it lasts for a short period of time, or chronic, meaning it persists for more than 12 weeks. It is estimated that 80% of adults will experience lower back pain at some point in their lives. Treatment for lumbago depends on the underlying cause and can include medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes.
