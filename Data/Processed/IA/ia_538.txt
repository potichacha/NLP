In your original post, answer the following: Suppose you are leading a project that will implement a new course-enrollment system for your university.

Additional information or insight you have on a concept from their post (do further research on something interesting you read).

It also provides multi-user access and advanced customer support. However, it is important to consider the specific needs and budget of the small business before making a final decision.
