Recommend a country and city where cost of living is low, quality of life high, good healthcare, some english is spoken, there are beaches and mountains accessible within two hours, and I would be within two hours of a major international airport.

I would recommend Da Nang, Vietnam. Da Nang is a coastal city in central Vietnam, known for its beautiful beaches and close proximity to both mountains and a major international airport. Cost of living: The cost of living in Da Nang is relatively low compared to other major cities around the world. Rent, transportation, and food costs are affordable, making it an attractive option for expats and digital nomads. Quality of life: Da Nang offers a high quality of life with modern amenities, a relaxed atmosphere, and a growing expat community. The city is clean and well-maintained, with a variety of leisure activities and outdoor pursuits available. Healthcare: Vietnam's healthcare system is improving, and Da Nang has several good-quality hospitals and medical facilities, including international clinics with English-speaking staff. Language: While Vietnamese is the official language, many locals in Da Nang, particularly in the service industry, speak English. This makes it easier for foreigners to communicate and navigate the city. Beaches and mountains: Da Nang has beautiful sandy beaches along its coastline, such as My Khe Beach and Non Nuoc Beach. The Marble Mountains and Ba Na Hills are within an hour's drive, offering opportunities for hiking and outdoor activities. Proximity to an international airport: Da Nang International Airport (DAD) is just a few kilometers from the city center, providing easy access to domestic and international destinations. The airport serves flights to major cities in Asia and is a convenient gateway for exploring the region. Overall, Da Nang offers a great balance of affordability, quality of life, and access to nature, making it an excellent choice for your criteria.
