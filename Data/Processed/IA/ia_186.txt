As an intern, the problem of data labeling and data capture through crowdsourcing for the improvement of AI interests me for several reasons. Firstly, the use of artificial intelligence is becoming more widespread in various industries, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we work and live. However, the accuracy of AI models is heavily reliant on high-quality labeled data, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Gigit.ai's solution of providing a platform for crowdsourcing data labeling and capture provides an efficient and cost-effective way for businesses to gather and label large amounts of data, ultimately improving the accuracy of AI models. Additionally, the platform provides opportunities for individuals globally to earn income through completing micro-jobs, promoting a more inclusive and diverse economy. Overall, the problem of data labeling and capture for AI is an exciting and innovative area, and I believe that Gigit.ai's solution can have a significant impact on the future of AI and the global workforce. As an intern, I am eager to contribute to this innovative solution and learn from the experience.

2 / 2Hello, Gigit.ai won a USD100K grant from Sequoia's Spark Program to gives users access to paid micro jobs such as data labeling and data capture. We're a team of Harvard MBA students looking for an intern who can help us run experiments in the Philippines and Southeast Asia.  You're a fit if you're able to grind through problems and can think of creative ways to get users on the platform. It's an added bonus if you know how to reach online communities like Discords, Facebook Groups and Tiktok.  This is a paid opportunity and we ask for around 5 hours / week.  Thank you so much for your interest.  Best, Paulo Tell me about a time you used grit and creativity to solve a problem? Write the best possible answers for an intern applicant? (probably about an experience in college where you used social media to make something viral, because it is related to the job description)
