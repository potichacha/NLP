What is the formula for Newton's method of training MLP neural network

Newton's method is an optimization algorithm that can be used for training multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The formula for Newton's method in the context of MLP neural network training is as follows: w_new = w_old - H^(-1) * g where: In practice, the calculation of the Hessian matrix can be computationally expensive, so approximations or simplified versions of Newton's method are often used instead. One such approach is the so-called quasi-Newton method, which approximates the Hessian matrix using a limited amount of information about the objective function and its gradient.

Write a Matlab code to test this formula realistic fully connected network with 10 inputs and 5 hidden nodes suitable for training with the practical Sunspots series

Here's an example Matlab code to train a fully connected neural network with 10 inputs, 5 hidden nodes, and a single output, using the practical Sunspots dataset: In this code, we first load the Sunspots dataset and normalize the input data to have zero mean and unit variance. We then set up a fully connected neural network with 10 inputs, 5 hidden nodes, and a single output, using the  feedforwardnet  function in Matlab. We also set the maximum number of epochs for training and the learning rate for Newton's method. Next, we initialize the weights of the network and define the objective function and its gradient using anonymous functions. The objective function is the mean squared error between the predicted outputs of the network and the true outputs, and the gradient is computed using the  tansig  activation function for the hidden layer. We then perform the Newton's method optimization by looping over the specified number of epochs, computing the gradient and Hessian matrix at each iteration, and updating the weights using the formula in the question. Finally, we evaluate the trained network on the training data and compute the mean squared error as a measure of performance. Note that this code assumes that the Sunspots dataset has already been loaded into memory, and that the  sunspotInputs  and  sunspotTargets  variables contain the input and output data, respectively. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code to load the data and preprocess it appropriately.
