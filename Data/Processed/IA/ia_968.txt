5 / 5I must compare the UX programs at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, the University of Maryland - College Park, and the Pratt Institute. I'd like you to elaborate a list of categories or factors to consider, provide a point weight for each category based on the importance of each factor to choose the best UX program. You have to take into account that I am a Fulbright scholar international student, that I am interested in landing an internship during the summer between year 1 and year 2 and doing academic training after year 2, that I have 70K of the total tuition for 2 years covered by a grant, and that I'll be getting a stipend between 1.5 and 2.9K each month towards living expenses. The more the cost of living in the place where the college is located, the higher the stipend I'll get, but it might happen that the living costs will exceed the stipend amount anyways. Don't forget to also consider all costs, weather, the opportunities to engage with American culture, the chances to meet locals during my master's degree, and the reputation each program has in US and Spain, as I will be returning to Spain after my academic training. Now list each program and score them in these categories
