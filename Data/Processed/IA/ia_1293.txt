DSS-induced colitis mouse mode

DSS-induced colitis mouse model is a widely used experimental model to study colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) in mice. DSS stands for dextran sulfate sodium, which is a chemical compound that, when added to the drinking water of mice, induces colonic inflammation, leading to symptoms similar to human IBD. In this model, mice are given DSS in their drinking water for a period of several days to induce acute colonic inflammation. The severity of colitis is assessed by measuring weight loss, stool consistency, and the presence of blood in the stool. Histological analysis of the colon is also performed to evaluate the extent of inflammation. The DSS-induced colitis mouse model is widely used to study the underlying mechanisms of IBD and to test potential therapeutic agents. The model has some limitations, such as the acute nature of the inflammation, but it remains a valuable tool for IBD research.
