Given the following user story, generate a Cypress Studio-compliant end-to-end spec: "As a(n) Logged-in Custodial Buyer on a(n) PDP page, I want to create a Non-Instant Buy offer in order to settle a transaction with a Logged-in Non-Custodial Seller via the Offer Modal."

Here's a possible Cypress Studio-compliant end-to-end spec for the given user story: This spec covers the two main parts of the user story: creating a Non-Instant Buy offer as a Logged-in Custodial Buyer on a PDP page, and settling the transaction with a Logged-in Non-Custodial Seller via the Offer Modal. It tests various UI elements and interactions, and uses custom data-testid attributes to make the tests more robust to UI changes.
