can you create me a netdata alert to trigger a warning if the node level anomaly rate over the last 1 minute goes over 5%?

Yes, I can help you create a Netdata alert to trigger a warning if the node level anomaly rate over the last 1 minute goes over 5%. Here are the steps to create the alert: Open the Netdata dashboard and go to the node that you want to create the alert for. Click on the "alarms" button on the left-hand side of the screen. Click on the "Create alarm" button. In the "Name" field, enter a descriptive name for your alarm, such as "Node Level Anomaly Rate Alert." In the "Expression" field, enter the following expression: This expression calculates the node level anomaly rate over the last 1 minute and triggers the alarm if it goes over 5%. In the "Message" field, enter a message that will be displayed when the alarm is triggered, such as "Node level anomaly rate is over 5%!" Set the "Severity" field to the appropriate level of severity for the alert. Click the "Create" button to save the alert. That\
