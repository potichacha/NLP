This will help identify areas where efficiencies can be gained and costs reduced. Developing a strategy: Based on the data analysis, develop a strategy for optimizing the supply chain. This may involve consolidating shipments, using alternative transportation modes, improving forecasting and planning processes, and implementing lean principles to reduce waste and inefficiencies. Implementing changes: Implement the changes identified in the strategy, and monitor the results to ensure that they are achieving the desired outcomes. This may involve working with third-party logistics providers or implementing new technology solutions. Continuous improvement: Supply chain optimization is an ongoing process, and it's important to continuously monitor and improve the supply chain to ensure that it remains efficient and effective. This involves regularly reviewing data and processes, identifying opportunities for improvement, and implementing changes as needed. Overall, optimizing CITGO's supply chain from refineries to terminals requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account all aspects of the supply chain, from transportation and storage to distribution and inventory management.
