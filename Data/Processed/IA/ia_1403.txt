Are you aware of any projects that make it easy to consume the ERCOT SOAP API in Python?

As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021, there isn't a specific Python library or project that is solely focused on consuming the ERCOT SOAP API. However, you can still work with the ERCOT SOAP API using general-purpose Python libraries like  requests  and  xml.etree.ElementTree  for making requests and parsing XML responses, respectively. Alternatively, you can use the  zeep  library, which is a modern and easy-to-use SOAP client for Python. To install it, use  pip : Here's a basic example of how to use the  zeep  library to consume the ERCOT SOAP API: Please note that you'll need to replace the placeholders in the example with the actual values specific to the ERCOT SOAP API. Keep in mind that my knowledge is up to September 2021, so there might be new projects or updates I'm not aware of. You can search for more recent resources by using search engines or checking popular code repositories such as GitHub.

Is there a way to use certificates with zeep?

Yes, you can use client-side certificates with the Zeep library in Python. To use a certificate, you'll need to configure the underlying  requests  library transport settings. Here's an example of how to use a client certificate with the Zeep library: In this example, you need to provide the paths to your client certificate (in PEM format), private key, and CA bundle (optional, if you want to verify the server's SSL certificate). Replace the placeholders with the appropriate file paths and API-specific details. Remember that using client certificates without proper protection can expose sensitive information. Ensure that you secure access to the certificate and key files by setting appropriate file permissions and storing them in secure locations.

Ok ERCOT also provides XSD files for their API. Can you show me how I could load XSDs into python objects, then consume those objects from a SOAP API?
