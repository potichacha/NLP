draw a cat using svg

As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to draw directly, but I can provide you with an example of a simple SVG code for a cat illustration: Copy and paste the code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the cat illustration. You can modify the code to change the cat's appearance, such as colors, shapes, or sizes.
