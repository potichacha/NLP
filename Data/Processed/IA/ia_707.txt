You have to act as a chief investment officer working for a financial advisory firm. You need to crear 5 model portfolios for 5 different risk profiles (risk scores 1 to 100) based on maximum drawdown. You need to combine only ETF and evaluate the return, volatility and expenses of each model portfolio

As the Chief Investment Officer of a financial advisory firm, I have created five model portfolios that cater to different risk profiles. The risk scores are categorized as follows: Each portfolio is constructed using a combination of ETFs that offer a balance of return, volatility, and expenses. The risk profiles are based on the maximum drawdown that an investor can tolerate. This portfolio focuses on capital preservation and low volatility. The majority of the assets are allocated to bonds, with a smaller allocation to domestic and international equities. Return: 4-6% Volatility: Low Expenses: Low This portfolio has a higher allocation to equities to increase potential returns while maintaining a significant bond allocation for stability. Return: 5-7% Volatility: Low to Medium Expenses: Low The moderate portfolio has a balanced allocation of domestic and international equities, with a smaller bond component to reduce volatility. Return: 6-8% Volatility: Medium Expenses: Low This portfolio has a higher allocation to equities to capitalize on growth opportunities, while maintaining a small bond allocation to cushion against market downturns. Return: 7-9% Volatility: Medium to High Expenses: Low This portfolio is geared towards investors with a high tolerance for risk and a long investment horizon. It has the highest allocation to equities and the lowest allocation to bonds. Return: 8-10% Volatility: High Expenses: Low Please note that past performance is not indicative of future results. It is essential to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

Can you do the same but not include any component for more than 30% weight in the overall portfolio. I'd also line to have an explanation of recent trends that support this selection, and a summary of the consensus of market forecast that make this a good portfolio.
