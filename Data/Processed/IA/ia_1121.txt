Let's review step by step how Javascript async functions work with Promises. Also let's review how the Javascript event loop works and how async code is actually executed in JS.

Create a Mermaid.JS flowchart that depicts the overview of how async functions and Promises interact with the event loop

The process starts with calling an async function and returning a Promise, and proceeds through awaiting an async operation, handling the operation in the Web APIs, and continuing the execution of the async function after resolving or rejecting the Promise.
