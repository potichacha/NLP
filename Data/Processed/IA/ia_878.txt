In your role as a blogging expert, I need some help in creating a content strategy for a personal website. This site is for me to talk about my experiences with mindset, biohacking, creating prompts for blogging and challenges with MS. I understand this is not a niche site that google will like, so I do not expect it to get traffic or earn money. My question is how do I organize this in a way that will make sense? Please write in English language.
