write a function that calculate fft of a matrix rows using eigen library in c++

Here is an example implementation of a function that uses the Eigen library in C++ to calculate the FFT of a matrix's rows: In this example, we first include the necessary Eigen libraries and the standard iostream library. The  fft_rows()  function takes a  MatrixXcd  object by reference and modifies it in place. It uses the  FFT<double>  class provided by the unsupported  Eigen/FFT  module to perform the FFT on each row of the matrix. In the  main()  function, we create a sample matrix  mat  with 3 rows and 4 columns and fill it with some sample values. We then print the original matrix, call  fft_rows()  on the matrix to calculate the FFT of each row, and print the resulting matrix. Note that in this example we assume that the matrix has complex-valued elements, represented by the  MatrixXcd  class in Eigen. If the matrix has real-valued elements, you should use the  MatrixXf  or  MatrixXd  class instead and modify the  FFT  class accordingly.

make the function accept a dynamic matrix of generic type

Here's an updated version of the  fft_rows()  function that accepts a dynamic matrix of generic type: In this version, we use the  Eigen::MatrixBase  template class to accept a dynamic matrix of any type that derives from  Eigen::MatrixBase . The  typedef typename Derived::Scalar Scalar;  line gets the scalar type of the matrix, which can be  float ,  double ,  std::complex<float> , or  std::complex<double> . We then create a  FFT  object with the appropriate scalar type and use it to perform the FFT on each row of the matrix. To call this function, you can pass any dynamic matrix to it, as long as it derives from  Eigen::MatrixBase . For example: In this example, we create two matrices of different types,  MatrixXd  and  MatrixXcf , and pass them to the  fft_rows()  function. The function handles both types correctly and modifies the matrices in place.

update the code so that the fft is taken over a window
