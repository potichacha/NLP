Tell me how to mount 2 drives in one folder on linux.

To mount two drives in one folder on Linux, you can use the  unionfs-fuse  package. Unionfs is a file system that allows you to merge multiple directories into a single directory. Here are the steps to mount two drives in one folder: In the command above, the  -o cow  option enables copy-on-write mode, which allows you to modify files on the merged directory without affecting the original files on the two drives. That's it! You can now access the merged directory at  /mnt/merged , which will contain the files and directories from both  /mnt/drive1  and  /mnt/drive2 .

Not that. Two drives are freshly installed. I need them put into a simple raid, then mount under a folder.

Sure, here are the steps to create a RAID array and mount it under a folder: The two drives will likely be named  /dev/sda  and  /dev/sdb , but this may vary depending on your system. 3. Create a RAID array using the  mdadm  tool. For example, to create a RAID 1 array (mirroring), run the following command: In the command above,  /dev/md0  is the name of the new RAID array,  --level=1  specifies the RAID level (mirroring),  --raid-devices=2  specifies the number of devices in the array, and  /dev/sda  and  /dev/sdb  are the two drives to be included in the array. 4. Wait for the array to finish syncing. You can monitor the progress of the sync using the following command: Add the following line to the end of the file: Save the file and exit the text editor. That's it! The new RAID array is now mounted at  /mnt/myraid  and is ready to use.

I don't need mirroring, but stripe. Repeat everything for that configuration.

Sure, here are the steps to create a RAID 0 array (striping) and mount it under a folder: The two drives will likely be named  /dev/sda  and  /dev/sdb , but this may vary depending on your system. 3. Create a RAID array using the  mdadm  tool. For example, to create a RAID 0 array (striping), run the following command: In the command above,  /dev/md0  is the name of the new RAID array,  --level=0  specifies the RAID level (striping),  --raid-devices=2  specifies the number of devices in the array, and  /dev/sda  and  /dev/sdb  are the two drives to be included in the array. 4. Wait for the array to finish syncing. You can monitor the progress of the sync using the following command: Add the following line to the end of the file: Save the file and exit the text editor. That's it! The new RAID array is now mounted at  /mnt/myraid  and is ready to use.

what if mdadm says 'device or resource busy'
