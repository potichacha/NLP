artist

Hi, my name is Maria. I am a 30-year-old artist from Brazil. I have been struggling with my English skills for a while now, and it's been affecting my work. Whenever I have meetings with potential clients or collaborators, I become shy and nervous, and my communication skills suffer. Sometimes, I even feel like I turn into a different person, and my mind goes blank. It's frustrating because I know I have great ideas, but I struggle to express them in English. I wish to improve my English because I want to expand my art career and work with people from all over the world. English is the language of business and art, and I don't want to limit myself to only working in Brazil. I also want to improve my confidence when communicating in English. I know that with better language skills, I can share my ideas more effectively, and my career will benefit as a result. I have tried watching English movies and TV shows, reading books and articles, and even taking some online courses. While these methods have helped me understand the language better, I still struggle to speak fluently and with confidence. I need to practice speaking with someone who can correct my mistakes and help me improve my pronunciation. I haven't been able to improve my English on my own because I need someone to practice speaking with. I don't have any friends or family members who speak English fluently, and I can't afford to pay for private lessons. That's why I'm looking for an affordable way to practice my English with someone who can help me improve my skills.
