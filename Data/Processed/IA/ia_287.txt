Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA): Fintech companies that offer electronic payment services must comply with the EFTA, which regulates electronic fund transfers and establishes consumer protections for electronic payments.

For example, New York has proposed the NYPA, which would establish a comprehensive privacy framework for the state. It is important for fintech companies to seek legal advice to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
