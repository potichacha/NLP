It also calculates a desired speed based on the distance to the ball, and uses that to determine the throttle value. When defending the goal, it does the same thing, but with the ball and the goal instead of the car and

very nice, can you re-analyse your code and fix the detected problems ?

Certainly! Here is the revised code, with some improvements and fixes:
