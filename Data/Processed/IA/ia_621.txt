{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To create a simple Python console app that uses ChatGPT, you\'ll need to have API access to the GPT model. OpenAI provides an API for this purpose, but you need an API key to use it. For this example, I\'ll use the  openai  library. You can install it with pip: Once you have the library installed, you can create a Python script like this: Replace the  OPENAI_API_KEY  with your own API key. This script sets up a simple console app that takes user input, sends it to the ChatGPT API, and prints out the response. To exit the app, simply type "exit".'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To securely store the  OPENAI_API_KEY ,  CLIENT_ID ,  CLIENT_SECRET , and  TENANT_ID  in your Flask app, you can use environment variables. You can create a  .env  file in your project's root directory and store your secrets in it. The  .env  file should not be committed to your version control system (e.g., Git). Make sure to add  .env  to your  .gitignore  file to prevent it from being accidentally committed. Here's how to set up the environment variables using a  .env  file: Create a  .env  file in your project's root directory. Add your secrets to the  .env  file as key-value pairs: At the beginning of your  app.py  file, add the following lines: With
