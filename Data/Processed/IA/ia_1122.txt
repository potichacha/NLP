Figma API doesn't have proper guide to apply auto layout in components or frames. We are implementing functionality which does drag and drop frames inside Figma canvas by using Figma JSON and try to apply autoLayout properties using Figma API.  Please write a sample code to apply autolayout in Figma canvas by using Figma API.

Sure, here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how to apply Auto Layout to a Frame in Figma using the Figma API: This code snippet assumes that you have already obtained the Figma Node ID of the Frame you want to apply Auto Layout to, and that you have authorized your Figma API credentials to access the file containing the Frame. Note that this code snippet only applies Auto Layout to a single Frame at a time. If you want to apply Auto Layout to multiple Frames or Components, you will need to modify the code to iterate over the selected Nodes and apply the layout properties accordingly.

what is primaryAxisAlign in Figma?

In Figma,  primaryAxisAlign  is a property that controls how items are aligned along the primary axis of an Auto Layout container. The primary axis is determined by the  layoutMode  property of the container. If the layout mode is set to "HORIZONTAL", the primary axis is the X-axis, and if the layout mode is set to "VERTICAL", the primary axis is the Y-axis. The  primaryAxisAlign  property can take one of the following values: By default,  primaryAxisAlign  is set to  MIN . You can change this property in the Auto Layout section of the Properties panel, or by setting it programmatically using the Figma API.
