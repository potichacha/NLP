write a children's short story about a woman who can make overalls look like a ballgown

Once upon a time, there was a woman named Rosie who lived in a small town. She was known for her love of overalls, and she wore them every day. She had overalls in every color and style, and she loved how comfortable they were. One day, the town was hosting a fancy ball, and everyone was getting dressed up in their best clothes. Rosie wanted to attend the ball, but she didn't have anything fancy to wear. She looked through her closet and saw all her overalls, but she knew she couldn't wear them to a fancy ball. But then she had an idea. Rosie took out her sewing machine and started working on her overalls. She sewed on some glittery fabric, added some sparkly buttons, and even made a flowing skirt to go over her overalls. After a few hours of sewing, Rosie had transformed her overalls into a beautiful ballgown. She looked in the mirror and couldn't believe how amazing she looked. She was so excited to go to the ball and show off her new outfit. When Rosie arrived at the ball, everyone was amazed by her outfit. They had never seen anyone wear overalls to a ball before, but Rosie had made them look like the most elegant dress anyone had ever seen. Rosie had a wonderful time at the ball, dancing and laughing with her friends. She was so happy that she had found a way to wear her beloved overalls to the ball, and that she had been able to show everyone that you don't have to wear a fancy dress to look beautiful. From that day on, Rosie became known as the woman who could make overalls look like a ballgown. And every time there was a fancy event in town, Rosie would be there, wearing her overalls and looking more stunning than anyone else in the room.
