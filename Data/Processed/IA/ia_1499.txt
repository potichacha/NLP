double.  0.2+0.1

The result of 0.2 + 0.1 in double precision arithmetic is: 0.30000000000000004 This happens because 0.2 and 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions in the limited precision of double floating-point format. Therefore, when they are added, the result is not exactly equal to 0.3, but rather the closest representable number to it.
