What is heavier, 0.000001 megagrams of steel or 1000000000 nanograms of feathers?

We can convert both quantities to the same unit of measurement, such as grams, to compare them directly. 0.000001 megagrams (Mg) is equal to 1 gram, since 1 Mg is equal to 1,000,000 grams. 1000000000 nanograms (ng) is equal to 1 gram, since 1 billion (10^9) nanograms is equal to 1 gram. Therefore, both quantities are equal to 1 gram. So neither is heavier than the other, they weigh the same.

But steel is heavier than feathers?

Yes, in general, steel is heavier than feathers, but the specific quantities given in the question are equal in weight. The question asked for a comparison between 0.000001 megagrams of steel and 1000000000 nanograms of feathers, which are equivalent to 1 gram each. It's important to note that when comparing the weight of two objects, we need to ensure that we are using the same unit of measurement for both objects. In this case, once we convert both quantities to grams, we can see that they have the same weight.

I don't get it...

I apologize for any confusion. Let me try to explain again. The question asked which of the following is heavier: 0.000001 megagrams of steel or 1000000000 nanograms of feathers. To answer this question, we need to compare the weight of these two quantities. However, 0.000001 megagrams and 1000000000 nanograms are not in the same unit of measurement, so we need to convert them to the same unit. 1 megagram (Mg) is equal to 1,000,000 grams, so 0.000001 megagrams is equal to 1 gram. 1 nanogram (ng) is equal to 0.000000001 grams, so 1000000000 nanograms is also equal to 1 gram. Therefore, both quantities have the same weight, which is 1 gram. So, in summary, even though steel is generally heavier than feathers, in this specific comparison, 0.000001 megagrams of steel and 1000000000 nanograms of feathers have the same weight.

Can you perhaps prove it to me visually?

Sure, I can try to illustrate it visually. One gram is the same weight regardless of the material it is made of, so we can represent both quantities on a balance scale that weighs in grams: As you can see in the illustration, both quantities have the same weight of 1 gram, so neither is heavier than the other. I hope this visual representation helps clarify the answer to your question.

But wouldn't 1 gram of steel be heavier than 1 gram of feathers? Because steel is heavier than feathers...
