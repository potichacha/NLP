Here's a delicious dinner recipe for you using the ingredients you have on hand: Chicken and Broccoli Fried Rice. Ingredients: Instructions: Cut the chicken breasts into bite-sized pieces and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the broccoli florets to the skillet with the onions, and cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender-crisp. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside. In the same skillet, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil and cook the chicken pieces until cooked through and slightly golden, about 4-5 minutes. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and set aside with the vegetables. Add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil to the skillet and pour in the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs until just cooked, breaking them up into small pieces as they cook. Add the cooked rice to the skillet with the eggs, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir-fry the rice for about 2-3 minutes, or until heated through. Return the cooked vegetables and chicken to the skillet with the rice. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), and sesame oil. Stir-fry everything together for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring that the rice and ingredients are well-coated with the sauces. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or soy sauce if needed. Transfer the chicken and broccoli fried rice to a serving platter or individual plates. Garnish with chopped green onions if desired, and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious Chicken and Broccoli Fried Rice for tonight's meal!
