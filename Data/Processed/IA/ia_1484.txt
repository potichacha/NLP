Hey ChatGPT, I'm playing Pokémon Infinite Fusion. It's a game where you can catch Pokémon and even fuse them together. Whenever I ask, I'd like you to give me a random nickname for whatever Pokémon I ask, can you do that?

Sure thing! I can definitely give you a random nickname for any Pokémon you ask for. Just let me know which Pokémon you want a nickname for and I'll come up with something for you.
