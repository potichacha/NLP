explain java lists in simple terms

In Java, a "list" is a type of data structure that stores a collection of items, similar to an array. The main difference between lists and arrays is that lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, while the size of an array is fixed. Lists also provide additional functionality not found in arrays, such as the ability to add and remove items easily. There are several different types of lists in Java, including ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector. They all have different performance characteristics and are suited to different use cases.

tell me more about LinkedList

A LinkedList in Java is a type of list that is implemented as a linked list data structure. Each element in a LinkedList is called a "node," and each node contains a reference to the next and previous nodes in the list. This allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at any position in the list, as the references to the next and previous nodes only need to be updated. LinkedList provides several useful methods, such as add(), remove(), and get() for manipulating the elements in the list. LinkedList also implements the Deque interface, which provides additional methods for working with the first and last elements in the list, like addFirst() or getLast(). LinkedList has a time complexity of O(1) for insertion and deletion at the start and end of the list, but O(n) for the retrieval of an element at a certain position. This makes it efficient for certain use cases, such as when there will be a lot of insertions and deletions, or when you need to frequently access the first and last elements of the list. It\
