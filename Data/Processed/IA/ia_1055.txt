Is there inductance torque sqrt relationship

I'm not entirely sure what you're asking. However, I'm assuming you're asking about the relationship between torque and inductance in an electric motor. In an electric motor, the torque produced is related to the inductance of the motor windings. Specifically, the torque produced by a motor is proportional to the square root of the inductance of the windings. This is because the inductance of the windings affects the current flow through the motor, and the current flow is what produces the magnetic field that generates the torque. A higher inductance means that the current will change more slowly, which in turn means that the magnetic field will change more slowly, resulting in a lower torque output. Therefore, if you increase the inductance of the motor, you will decrease the torque output, and vice versa. The relationship between torque and inductance is not a simple linear one, but rather a square root relationship.

What if the current is constant? I think the relationship is different. Anythng to do with number of winding?

If the current through the motor is held constant, the relationship between torque and inductance will be different than what I described earlier. In this case, the torque produced by the motor will be directly proportional to the inductance of the windings. This is because, with a constant current, the magnetic field strength in the motor is also constant. The torque produced by the motor is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and the number of turns of the wire in the windings. Therefore, if the current is held constant, the torque produced will be directly proportional to the inductance of the windings, which is itself proportional to the number of turns of wire in the windings. In summary, the relationship between torque and inductance in an electric motor depends on the operating conditions. If the current is constant, the torque will be directly proportional to the inductance, which in turn is proportional to the number of turns of wire in the windings. However, if the current is allowed to vary, the torque will be proportional to the square root of the inductance.

You stated torque is proportional to inductance and torque is proportional to number of turns. Is inductance proportinal to number of turns?
