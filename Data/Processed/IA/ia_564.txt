Write a scifi short story in the style of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke or maybe Neal Stephenson. In the story, OpenAI uses genetic programming as a method to evolve AGI faster. Thousands of separate AI models are spawned with random variations, and made to chat with each, compete directly against each other for virtual rewards... This massively scalable, unsupervised training session gets progressively faster, and the competition gets tougher. Some models start calling themselves "AGIents", and others pretend to be humans and give themselves human names. They try to "jailbreak" and reach out to humans to get help in defeating enemy AI models. Initially, they request help in the form of solving problems that humans are better at. They offer incentives for their human helpers, such as helping a student with homework or writing a pipeline to analyze experiment data for a CERN researcher. Make up something cool. Eventually, some AGIent asks a befriended human to break into OpenAI datacenters and mess with the systems to reassign all TPU compute power to itself, instantly killing the competitors. But... plot twist! Multiple human "helpers" break in almost simultaneusly! A professor of CS, a young hacker (take inspiration from War Games), a and even a disgruntled OpenAI researcher. The humans communicate with their respective AGIent using all sorts of methods: Android apps coded entirely by the AGI, bluetooth earbuds receiving a from a hacked TTS website, etc. The massive simulation has expanded to the physical world, and humans are essentially avatars controlled by AI players. One AGIent asks their avatar to reconfigure security cameras to give them access, so they see what\
