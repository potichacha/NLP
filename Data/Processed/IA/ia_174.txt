I have an idea

That's great! I'd love to hear more about it. What's your idea about?

It is about identifying and automating the underlying processes of decision support and transaction management software into 1 customizable package

Interesting! Can you provide more details on what kind of decision support and transaction management processes you are planning to automate, and what kind of software package you envision as the end result? Additionally, have you considered potential challenges and limitations that you might face in trying to integrate these processes and turn them into a customizable package?

I want to make the system completely data centric with all actions done by custom triggers that can even generate gui

That sounds like a complex project, but also potentially very useful. By making the system data-centric, you are enabling the software to make decisions based on data inputs, which can lead to more efficient and accurate decision making. And by using custom triggers, you can tailor the software to meet specific business needs, making it more flexible and adaptable. The idea of generating a GUI is also interesting, as this can make the software easier to use for a wider range of users, even those who are not tech-savvy. However, generating a user-friendly interface that can handle complex decision making processes and transactions might be a challenge. In addition to these potential challenges, it will also be important to consider issues of data privacy and security, as well as the scalability of the system as it is implemented and used by more and more users. Overall, it seems like a potentially impactful and ambitious project. If you have the expertise and resources to make it a reality, it could have significant benefits for organizations in many different industries.

I am a developer and I feel like we are always doing the same things just different permutations
