4 / 4I need help with creating my final project proposal for my advertising class. You are to develop research question(s) and provide a 2-3 page double-spaced summary of your topic. Your research questions and/or project purpose should be succinctly stated.  The consumer behavior concepts and theories that you expect to use should be clearly outlined, with a discussion of why you think that they are relevant and how you think they apply to your topic of interest. In addition, you should include next steps, and the type of research that you plan to incorporate into your project.  The proposal should give the professor a solid understanding of your proposed project. Students are also encouraged to incorporate relevant literature to help build their case.
