How can I show a custom name instead of the client id when creating and editing files in SharePoint via an app using the code below? uploadFile.ListItemAllFields["Author"] = context.Web.EnsureUser(clientId); uploadFile.ListItemAllFields["Editor"] = context.Web.EnsureUser(clientId); uploadFile.ListItemAllFields.Update(); context.ExecuteQuery();

You can use the  Web.GetUserById  method to retrieve the user object for the client ID, and then set the  Title  property of the user object to the custom name you want to display. Here is an example of how you could update the code you provided to use a custom name: This will set the "Author" and "Editor" fields of the file to the user object with the custom name you specified.

How can I keep the APP as the uploaded file Author/creator but show the activity log as modified by another user's email instead?

In order to keep the app as the file author/creator, but show the activity log as modified by another user\

How can I stop it from changing the modified/editor name of all previous uploaded files also?

To prevent the modification of the "Editor" field from affecting the previously uploaded files, you need to make sure that you only modify the "Editor" field for the specific file that you are currently uploading, and not for all files in the SharePoint library. To achieve this, you need to make sure that you are only calling the  Update  method on the specific file object that you are currently uploading, and not on the entire SharePoint library. Here is an example of how you could update your code to achieve this: This will only update the "Editor" field for the specific file that you are currently uploading, and not for all files in the SharePoint library. Alternatively, you could query the library to find the specific file you want to update and set the editor field only for that file. This way you are querying the library for the specific file you want to update and then updating only that file.
