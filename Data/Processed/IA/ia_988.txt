I want to parse a struct in a go source file and want to generate a avro schema from it. Please write a Go program that receives the name of the Go source file and the name of the struct that should be converted. It should output a file named struct.avsc

To achieve this, you can use the  go/ast  and  go/parser  packages to parse the Go source file, extract the struct, and then convert it to an Avro schema. Here's a simple Go program that does this: Save this program as  main.go . To use this program, run: Replace  <source.go>  with the name of your Go source file and  <StructName>  with the name of the struct

I get named files must all be in one directory; have . and ../db2stream/welo/user

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that you're trying to parse a Go file from a different package. In this case, you should use the  go/packages  package to load the desired package and then parse the source file. Here's an updated version of the program that does this:

please explain the difference between these two variants

Sure! The main difference between the two variants is how they handle Go source files and packages. In the first variant, the program uses the  go/parser  package to parse a single Go source file, assuming it's in the same package as the program itself. This might be suitable for simpler use cases, where you only need to handle a single file in the same package. However, this approach has limitations, as it doesn't handle multiple files in a package or files from other packages. In the second variant, the program uses the  go/packages  package from  golang.org/x/tools/go/packages  to load and parse an entire package, including Go files from other packages. This is a more robust and flexible solution, as it can handle multiple files within a package and source files from other packages. This approach is more suitable for real-world use cases, where your target struct might be defined in a different package or spread across multiple files. In summary, the first variant is a simpler approach that works for single Go source files within the same package, while the second variant is more flexible and can handle source files from different packages and multiple files within a package.

Please update the program so that it saves the result relative to the package root with a filename given on the comandline. if that filename is not given, use the lower case name of the struct and add .avsc as extension and store it in the package root.

Here's an updated version of the program that saves the Avro schema file relative to the package root, using the filename provided in the command line or the lower case struct name with  .avsc  extension if no filename is given:
