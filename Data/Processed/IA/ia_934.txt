{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "1) No, but I am trying to limit my meat intake and experiment with mushrooms more (but don't make them too much of a focus) 2) Greek and Mediterranean food are wonderful, but I also love traditional and ethnic cuisine (want to experiment with African food) 3) none other than what I already mentioned! 4) I want to meal prep with easy recipes to store and eat throughout the week. It will be for me and sometimes my girlfriend (I want to impress her) 5) about a half hour prep time is the high end of what I enjoy but am fine with longer cook times I have to monitor"}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Thank you for sharing your preferences! Based on your input, I have come up with a few recipe summaries for you to consider.

They are designed to be relatively quick to prepare and suitable for meal prepping throughout the week.
