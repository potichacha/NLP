Derive the 2-by-2 matrix B of the transformation L(x) = Bx which projects the vector x = [x1 x2] onto the second axis (i.e. on the x2-axis).

To project a vector onto the second axis (x2-axis), we can set the first coordinate of the vector to zero, and leave the second coordinate unchanged. Let's consider the standard basis vectors e1 and e2, where e1 = [1, 0] and e2 = [0, 1]. To project e1 onto the x2-axis, we set its first coordinate to zero, so we get the projected vector [0, 0]. To project e2 onto the x2-axis, we leave its coordinates unchanged, so we get the projected vector [0, 1]. Now, we can represent the projection matrix B as follows: To verify that B indeed projects vectors onto the x2-axis, let's apply it to an arbitrary vector x = [x1, x2]: As expected, the result is the projection of x onto the x2-axis.
