Why electric vehicles did not have success in the past?

There are several reasons why electric vehicles did not have much success in the past, some of which include: Limited Range: Early electric vehicles had a limited driving range of only a few tens of miles, which made them unsuitable for long trips. This was due to the limitations of battery technology at the time, which did not allow for a high energy density. High Cost: Electric vehicles were more expensive to produce than petrol vehicles due to the high cost of batteries and other components. This made them less attractive to consumers, who were looking for cheaper alternatives. Lack of Charging Infrastructure: In the past, there was a lack of charging infrastructure, which made it difficult for electric vehicle owners to recharge their vehicles while on the road. This made electric vehicles less practical for everyday use, as they had to be recharged at home overnight. Limited Model Availability: Electric vehicles were not widely available in the past, and most were only sold in select markets. This limited the choices available to consumers, making it more difficult for them to make the switch to electric. Perception Issues: In the past, electric vehicles were seen as slow, unattractive, and impractical. This perception made it difficult for them to gain mass appeal among consumers. Today, however, many of these issues have been addressed. Battery technology has improved, driving ranges have increased, and charging infrastructure is more widely available. Electric vehicles are also becoming more affordable and are available in a wider variety of models. As a result, electric vehicles are becoming an increasingly popular choice for consumers who are looking for environmentally friendly and cost-effective transportation options.
