Is there an SDK I can use?

Yes, FL Studio provides an SDK called the FL Studio SDK, which allows developers to create plugins and extensions for the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). The SDK is primarily designed for creating VST plugins, native FL Studio plugins (such as effects, generators, and controllers), and other extensions. The FL Studio SDK is written in C/C++, and you can find the documentation and the SDK files on the Image-Line website. To get started, you can visit their developer portal and download the SDK, along with example projects and documentation: Please note that the SDK is not for Python, but for C/C++. If you want to develop plugins or extensions for FL Studio, you will need to have some experience with C/C++ programming. However, you can still use Python for other parts of your project and communicate with your C/C++ code using various inter-process communication methods or language bindings like ctypes or Boost.Python.
