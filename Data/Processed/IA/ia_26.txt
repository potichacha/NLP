Make this sound more professional: [6:32 AM] Gildehaus, Andy Additionally I've fixed a few minor bugs I found in the notification group editor in the condition of having no buildings (the page was erroring when there were no buildings) and did some very minor UI cleanups there (added some text to better show the state of things in certain conditions, some layout improvements). \xa0 I have a couple minor database migrations to create a bit later this morning to get things in sync with production (I added an index to prod to help with a performance issue and it needs to become a migration and get applied to dev/test, and I added two new flags to test/ prod that also need to be added to the migrations). \xa0 But the system champion changes should be ready for test. [6:35 AM] Gildehaus, Andy This is the sort of feature that you can test once or twice to prove the code works, but you really should test to see if it does the right thing in production, with production data. \xa0Will it email the right people? \xa0Are there problems anywhere? \xa0 Basically I need to run the query that retrieves the backup recipients against every SBS in production, extract the recipients it produces, and pull them all into Excel for all of us to sanity check. \xa0 I'll try to get that done.

Good morning, I have made some minor bug fixes in the notification group editor for the case where there are no buildings, and I have also done some minor UI cleanup in that area by adding some text to better display the status in certain conditions and improving the layout. Later this morning, I will be creating a couple of minor database migrations to ensure that the development and testing environments are in sync with production. These migrations will include an index that was added to production to address a performance issue, as well as the addition of two new flags that have been implemented in test and production. The system champion changes should now be ready for testing. It is important to thoroughly test this feature in production with real data to ensure that the correct individuals are being emailed and that there are no issues with the implementation. To do this, I will run the query that retrieves the backup recipients for every SBS in production, extract the recipients, and compile them in an Excel spreadsheet for review. I will try to complete this task as soon as possible.

Make it shorter. Much shorter.

I have made minor bug fixes and UI improvements in the notification group editor for cases with no buildings. I will create minor database migrations to sync dev/test environments with production. The system champion changes are ready for testing and I will run a query to retrieve and review the backup recipients for every SBS in production.
