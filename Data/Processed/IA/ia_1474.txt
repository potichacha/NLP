There were 5 people and 12 candies arranged in 4 rows by 3 columns. Everybody ate one candy. They ate rowwise from top bottom and within a row from left to right. How many rows of candies are left?

There are a total of 5 x 12 = 60 candies. Since each person ate one candy in each row, there are 4 rows and 5 people, so a total of 4 x 5 = 20 candies were eaten. Therefore, there are 60 - 20 = 40 candies left. Since there are 4 rows, and each row has 3 candies, there are a total of 4 x 3 = 12 candies in the arrangement. Therefore, there are 12 - 3 = 9 rows of candies left after everyone has eaten one candy row-wise from top to bottom and within a row from left to right.
