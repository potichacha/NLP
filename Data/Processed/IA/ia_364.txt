In physics simulations, a fixed time step causes different behaviour depending on how many FPS the user's machine can run the simulation at. How to fix this?

In physics simulations, using a fixed time step can indeed lead to different behavior depending on the user's machine performance and FPS (frames per second). To address this issue, you can use a technique called frame-rate independent or delta-time-based physics update. Here's how you can implement this: By using delta time in your physics calculations, the simulation will be frame-rate independent and should behave consistently across different machines, regardless of their FPS. Keep in mind that using variable time steps can lead to instability in certain physics simulations, such as when using Verlet integration or in some collision detection scenarios. In such cases, consider using a semi-fixed time step approach, where you accumulate delta time and update physics in fixed increments while still considering the delta time for the remainder. This method combines the benefits of fixed time steps (stability) with the flexibility of variable time steps (frame-rate independence).

Okay, can you elaborate why variable time steps lead to instability for Verlet integration? Then can you show me how to implement the semi-fixed time step approach?

Variable time steps can lead to instability in Verlet integration due to the way it calculates position and velocity. Verlet integration is an explicit integration method that uses the previous two positions to calculate the next position. When using variable time steps, the differences in delta time between successive steps can lead to inaccuracies in position and velocity calculations, which can accumulate over time and cause instability in the simulation. Here's how you can implement the semi-fixed time step approach: In the  render()  function, use the interpolation factor (alpha) to interpolate between the previous and current state of physics objects: This approach ensures that your physics updates occur at a fixed time step, providing stability to the simulation while still allowing for frame-rate independence in rendering.

Show me how to do the above with Verlet integration

To implement the semi-fixed time step approach with Verlet integration, you can follow these steps: Now, let's implement the Verlet integration in the  updatePhysics()  function: In the  render()  function, use the interpolation factor (alpha) to interpolate between the previous and current state of physics objects: This implementation of Verlet integration with the semi-fixed time step approach ensures that your physics updates occur at a fixed time step, providing stability to the simulation while still allowing for frame-rate independence in rendering.
