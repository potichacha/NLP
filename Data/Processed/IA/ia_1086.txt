what all innovations happened in last 100-200 years to make chatgpt level technology possible, eg transistors, chips etcShare Prompt

The development of ChatGPT level technology has been made possible by a wide range of technological innovations over the past 100-200 years. Some of the most significant innovations include: The invention of the telegraph in the early 1800s, which laid the foundation for long-distance communication by transmitting electrical signals over wires. The development of computers and digital electronics in the mid-20th century, which allowed for the processing and storage of large amounts of information. The invention of the transistor in 1947, which revolutionized the field of electronics by enabling the creation of smaller, more efficient electronic devices. The development of integrated circuits (ICs) in the 1960s, which allowed for the miniaturization of electronic components and paved the way for the creation of microprocessors. The invention of the microprocessor in 1971, which allowed for the creation of the first personal computers and ushered in the era of modern computing. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning techniques in the 21st century, which have enabled machines to learn from data and make predictions based on that data. The growth of the internet and the availability of large datasets, which have provided the raw material for training large language models like ChatGPT. Overall, the development of ChatGPT-level technology has been made possible by a combination of advances in communication technology, electronics, computer hardware, and software development.

can you explain in more details how each of the above helped create a computer or mobile that is so powerful today. i want to understand each thing in depth. let's start with transistors?Share Prompt
