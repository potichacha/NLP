I want to create a stacked lstm, with size of 7 timestemps

To create a stacked LSTM model with a sequence length of 7 time steps, you can use TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular deep learning libraries in Python. Here's an example of how you can create such a model: Before training the model, you need to preprocess your data. You'll need to convert your data into the appropriate format, i.e., samples with 7 time steps each and a single feature. Here's a generic example:

in pytorch

To create a stacked LSTM model with a sequence length of 7 time steps in PyTorch, follow these steps: Before training the model, you need to preprocess your data. You'll need to convert your data into the appropriate format, i.e., samples with 7 time steps each and a single feature. Here's a generic example: Remember to adapt the data preprocessing and model training code according to your specific dataset and requirements.

I want the output of the series to be only True/False, so for example if the series is "My name is Eran and I am happy" , so the output would be correspond to those words, True,False,False,False,True,False,False,True

To create a stacked LSTM model that predicts True/False values for each word in a sentence, you'll need to modify the architecture and training process accordingly. Here's a step-by-step guide using PyTorch: In this step, you'll need to preprocess your data and create a dataset that contains the input sentences and their corresponding True/False labels. Use the  torchtext.data.Field  and  torchtext.data.TabularDataset  to create a dataset from a CSV file:
