I need you to generate a fitness plan for me. I can exercise for one hour between 10-11am and only three times a week. I do not have access to a gym, so I need easy, at-home workouts. Can you give me a workout schedule for 3 days?

Sure, here is a simple workout plan that you can do at home: Monday: Wednesday: Friday: Remember to always listen to your body and only do what feels comfortable and safe. You can always adjust the number of sets and reps based on your fitness level and how you're feeling. It's also important to incorporate rest days into your workout schedule to give your body time to recover.
