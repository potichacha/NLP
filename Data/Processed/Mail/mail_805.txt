Dear John,

Thank you for providing the additional details. Our team has investigated the issue, and we have identified that the parsing error is related to a known bug in the Mercury language version 1.2.3 that is triggered by a specific compiler optimization introduced in the latest Ubuntu update. 

We have developed a patch for this bug in the upcoming Mercury language version 1.2.4, which will be released within the next 24 hours. In the meantime, you can apply a temporary workaround by disabling the problematic compiler optimization in your server's environment.

To disable the compiler optimization, please follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and log in as root.
2. Edit the Mercury language configuration file by running the command: `sudo nano /etc/mercury/mercury.conf`
3. Locate the line `optimization-level=3` and change it to `optimization-level=2`.
4. Save the file and exit the editor.
5. Restart the Mercury language service by running the command: `sudo systemctl restart mercury`

This workaround will disable the problematic compiler optimization and should resolve the parsing error. Please note that disabling this optimization might slightly impact the performance of your Mercury code.

We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused and appreciate your patience as we work to resolve it permanently with the upcoming release. 

Please let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
