Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble finding clear documentation on how to implement custom error handling in Mercury. The examples in the current documentation seem outdated and don't align with the latest version I'm using.

Could you please point me to the correct resources or provide some guidance on this?

Thanks,
John Doe
