Hi Aetheros Support,

I am experiencing a critical issue where I am unable to access the API dashboard for our organization. I believe this might be related to my IAM role permissions, as I was recently reassigned within the team. 

I have tried logging out and back in, but the problem persists. This is severely impacting our development workflow as we cannot monitor our API performance or access crucial analytics.

Please investigate this urgently and let me know what steps are needed to resolve this issue.

Thank you,
