Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing an urgent issue where our custom role assignments in Mercury code are not reflecting correctly within the IAM service. This is causing authorization failures for our application.

Specifically, we're using the `assignRole` function in Mercury with the correct role ID and user ID, but the user is still denied access based on those roles.

We've checked our code thoroughly and everything seems to be in order. Could you please investigate this issue as soon as possible?

Thanks,
John Doe
