We are experiencing a critical issue with the Aetheros API Monitoring service. We're getting flooded with false positive alerts about API downtime, but our actual API endpoints are all operational. 

This is causing significant disruption to our team as we're spending valuable time investigating these false alarms.  We need this resolved urgently. Please advise on next steps.

Sincerely,
John Doe
