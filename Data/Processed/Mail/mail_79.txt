We are experiencing a critical issue with our Aetheros cloud instance. It has become unreachable within the last hour, and we are unable to access our applications or data. Additionally, we're having trouble managing user permissions through the IAM service. Attempts to modify roles are resulting in errors. This is a high-priority issue impacting our operations, and we need immediate assistance.
