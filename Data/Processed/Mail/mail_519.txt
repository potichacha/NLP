Dear John Doe,

We have identified the issue causing the API access errors and monitoring dashboard outage. It was related to a recent security update that inadvertently impacted access permissions. Our team has implemented a fix, and API access should be restored now. The monitoring dashboard will be available shortly.

We apologize for the inconvenience this outage caused.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
