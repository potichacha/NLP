Hi Aetheros Support,

My name is John Doe, and I'm a developer working with [Project Name] at [Company Name]. We're currently leveraging your IAM service and Cloud management platform.

I need to request an urgent reset for my IAM credentials as I believe they might have been compromised. I'm unable to access our resources, and I suspect unauthorized activity.

Additionally, we've noticed some discrepancies in our latest cloud resources bill. Could you please provide a breakdown of the charges related to our account for the past billing cycle?

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
John Doe
