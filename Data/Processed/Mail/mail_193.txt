We are experiencing a critical issue with the Mercury Language compiler in our production environment. 

Since updating to the latest version (v2.3.1), our API build is failing with the following error:

```
[ERROR] Mercury Compiler - Unexpected token '->'
```

This is impacting our live API and causing significant disruption to our services. We have rolled back to the previous compiler version for now, but this is not a sustainable solution.

Please advise on a fix or workaround as soon as possible.
