Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your suggestion regarding integrating RBAC into Mercury with our IAM service. We appreciate you taking the time to provide this valuable feedback.

We understand the benefits of having more streamlined RBAC within the Mercury language. We'll forward your suggestion to our development team for further evaluation.

In the meantime, could you please provide some more details about your current workflow and the specific challenges you're facing with managing permissions in your Mercury code? This information would be helpful for our team to better understand your needs.

Best regards,
