Hello John,

Thank you for providing the additional information. Based on your current setup and peak load metrics, we recommend considering the following:

1. **Upgrade to m5.xlarge instances:** These offer double the CPU cores and memory compared to m5.large, which should significantly improve your peak performance.
2. **Implement auto-scaling:** This feature automatically adjusts the number of instances based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal resource allocation and cost efficiency.

We can assist you with implementing these changes. Please let us know if you would like to schedule a consultation with one of our cloud specialists.

Regards,
Aetheros Support Team
