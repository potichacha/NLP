We are experiencing critical issues deploying our latest application update to our Aetheros cloud environment. 

Specifically, the API built with Mercury Language is failing to deploy correctly, causing a chain reaction that's preventing the entire application from coming online. 

We've reviewed the deployment logs and haven't been able to isolate the root cause. 

This is a high-priority issue as it's impacting our live production environment. We need immediate assistance to resolve this. Please advise on next steps ASAP.
