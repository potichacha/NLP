Dear John,

We have identified the issue causing the IAM roles to malfunction. There was a temporary glitch in our system affecting role propagation to cloud resources. Our engineers have fixed the root cause, and all affected roles should now be functioning correctly.

We sincerely apologize for the extended downtime and any inconvenience this may have caused. Please confirm if you are now able to access the affected resources.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
