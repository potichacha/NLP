Hello John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We understand your query regarding user role inheritance in our IAM service.

To clarify, directly denying a permission to a user will indeed take precedence, even if that permission is inherited from another role the user is assigned to. This ensures granular control over user permissions.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best Regards,
Aetheros Support Team
