Hi Isiah,

Thank you for reaching out. We've looked into the latency spikes you reported and identified that they were caused by a brief network hiccup on our end. The issue has now been resolved, and your API performance should be back to normal. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
