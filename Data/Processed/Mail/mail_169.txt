Hi John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support.

We understand you're facing difficulties integrating Mercury with our IAM service. To assist you effectively, could you please provide more details about your setup?

Specifically, it would be helpful to know:

* The version of Mercury you're using
* How you're configuring IAM roles within your Mercury code
* A code snippet demonstrating the role validation logic

Once we have this information, we'll be in a better position to identify the root cause of the issue.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
