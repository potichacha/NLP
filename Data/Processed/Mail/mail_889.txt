Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm experiencing some irregular latency spikes with my API being monitored through your platform.  Most of the time, response times are great, but I'm seeing intermittent spikes up to several seconds. 

Could you help me investigate what might be causing this?

Thanks,
John Doe
