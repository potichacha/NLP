Hi Aetheros Support,

Thanks for looking into this. The latency issue seems to have improved, but we're still seeing occasional spikes, albeit less frequently.

Could you please provide us with more detailed information on the network congestion issue and the steps taken to resolve it? 

We would also appreciate recommendations on how to proactively monitor and mitigate such issues in the future, especially using your API monitoring service. 

Regards,
John Doe
