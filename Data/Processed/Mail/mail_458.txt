Hello Aetheros Support,

I'm working with the Mercury language for our API development, and I'm having trouble finding clear documentation on how to implement custom error handling. Specifically, I want to define unique error codes and messages to return from my API. 

Could you point me to the relevant documentation or provide an example?

Thanks,
John Smith
