Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm encountering difficulties deploying a Mercury application to AWS using Aetheros Cloud Management. The deployment process seems to hang indefinitely after the initial resource provisioning. I've double-checked my configuration files and they appear to be in order. 

Could you please advise on how to troubleshoot this?

Thanks,
John Doe
