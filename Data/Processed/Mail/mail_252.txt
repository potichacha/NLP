Hi John,

We've identified and resolved the issue. There was a temporary glitch in our authorization service that caused incorrect permission evaluations. This has now been fixed. 

Could you please ask the affected users to try accessing the resources again? They should now have the correct access. 

We apologize for the inconvenience caused. 

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
