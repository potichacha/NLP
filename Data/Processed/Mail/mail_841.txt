Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having a bit of trouble understanding how to set up granular permissions for different user roles within the IAM service. Specifically, I want to allow certain users to view API analytics but not edit API configurations. Is this possible with the current role-based access control system?

Thanks,
John Doe
