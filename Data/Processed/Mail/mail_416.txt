Hi Aetheros Support,

Thank you for the detailed response. That's helpful to know.

We have another question regarding user provisioning. Can we integrate our existing identity provider (IDP) with Aetheros for user authentication and authorization?

We are currently using [Name of IDP]. If you can share some information about the integration process or documentation for our specific IDP, that would be great.

Thank you,
Isabella
