Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support.

We understand you are experiencing high latency issues with the /products API endpoint. To help us diagnose the issue effectively, could you please provide us with the following information:

* Approximate times and dates when the latency spikes occurred.
* Screenshots of the latency spikes from the API monitoring platform.
* Any error messages or codes you encountered during these periods.

Once we have this information, we can investigate the issue further and provide a solution.

Sincerely,
