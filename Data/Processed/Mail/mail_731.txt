Dear John,

You're welcome! We're glad to hear that the instance sizing and autoscaling changes have improved your application's performance.

Regarding the unusual spikes in API latency during off-peak hours, it's worth investigating further. While it's possible they are related to the recent changes, there could be other factors involved.

To help us pinpoint the cause, could you please provide us with the following information:

* The approximate time these spikes occurred.
* The specific API endpoints affected.
* Any relevant logs or error messages from the affected time frame.

Once we have more information, we can analyze the situation and determine the root cause of these latency spikes.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
