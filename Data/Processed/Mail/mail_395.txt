Hi John,

We have identified the issue. It was related to a recent update in our IAM service that unintentionally affected access permissions for your cloud instance. We have corrected the issue and restored access.

The API monitoring dashboard should be updating shortly. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. 

Please let us know if you experience any further issues.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
