Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent latency spikes with our production API that's being monitored by your platform. These spikes don't seem to follow a pattern and are impacting our application performance.

Could you please investigate this and advise on any potential solutions or configurations we might need to adjust?

Thanks,
John Doe
