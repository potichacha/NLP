Hi,

Yes, we did update a Mercury script for data validation within Project Phoenix API yesterday. It's possible that this might be causing the latency issues.

We'll revert the script changes for now and monitor the API performance. Please let us know if you have any further findings on your end.

Regards,
Isabella
