Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working on a project using Mercury Language, and I'm having a bit of trouble finding the most efficient way to do some complex string manipulations.  Specifically, I need to extract certain data from a long string based on a pattern. 

Could you point me towards any documentation or examples that deal with this kind of string processing in Mercury?  

Thanks,
Isabella Davis
