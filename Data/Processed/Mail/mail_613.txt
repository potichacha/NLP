Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement to the Cloud Management dashboard. It would be incredibly helpful if we could see a real-time visualization of resource consumption (CPU, memory, etc.) directly on the main dashboard. This would provide a quick and easy way to monitor the health of our deployments. 

Thanks,
John Doe
