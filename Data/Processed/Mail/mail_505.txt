Aetheros Support Team,

I've attached the error logs and one of the problematic scripts. We've noticed a spike in memory usage just before the crashes occur. However, we are unsure what within the Mercury script is causing this excessive memory consumption.

Please advise on how to proceed. This issue is now severely impacting our production environment.

Regards,
John Doe
