Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing an issue with our IAM roles that is preventing our developers from accessing the necessary resources to compile our Mercury code. 

Specifically, developers with the 'Mercury Developer' role are receiving authorization errors when attempting to compile code that interacts with our 'PaymentProcessing' API. 

We have verified that the 'Mercury Developer' role should have the correct permissions according to our IAM policy. 

This issue is causing significant delays in our development cycle. We need this resolved as soon as possible.

Please advise on how to proceed.

Thanks,
John Doe
