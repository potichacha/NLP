Hi Aetheros Support,

Thanks for the quick response. Here is the information you requested:

* We're seeing increased latency, particularly on API endpoints related to user authentication and data retrieval during peak hours (roughly between 6 PM and 8 PM UTC).
* We are currently using the standard 't2.medium' instances for our application servers.
* We haven't configured any autoscaling policies yet as we're unsure about the best approach.

Please let me know if you require any further details.

Regards,
John Doe
