Dear Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing significant API performance degradation following a recent update to the Mercury language runtime. Our API, which manages high-volume transactions, is now experiencing response times exceeding acceptable thresholds, impacting our services severely.

We have pinpointed the issue to coincide with the deployment of the Mercury 1.2.5 runtime update. Prior to this, our API performance was within acceptable parameters.

We are requesting immediate assistance to diagnose and resolve this issue as it is critically impacting our operations.

Sincerely,
John Doe
