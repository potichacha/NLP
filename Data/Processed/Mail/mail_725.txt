Dear Isabella,

Thank you for your email and for the valuable suggestion regarding Mercury's error handling. We understand how crucial detailed error messages are for efficient debugging and a smooth development experience.

We appreciate you taking the time to provide such specific feedback. We've shared your suggestion with our development team, and they are currently reviewing it for potential implementation in future releases of the Mercury language.

In the meantime, would you be open to scheduling a quick call with one of our engineers to discuss your specific use case and any potential workarounds you might be able to implement for now?

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
