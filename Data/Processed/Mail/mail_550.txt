Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some difficulties scaling our cloud resources effectively through your platform. Our application experiences significant slowdowns during peak hours, and we believe it's related to resource limitations. 

Could you please advise on how to best diagnose and address this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
