Dear Isiah,

Thank you for providing the requested information. We've analyzed the logs you shared and identified an issue with the autoscaling configuration of your cloud resources. This misconfiguration seems to be causing delays in scaling up resources during peak hours, leading to the latency you're experiencing.

We've corrected the autoscaling configuration, and you should see significant improvements in your application performance. Please allow for a few hours for the changes to fully propagate.

We'll continue to monitor the situation closely. If you experience any further issues, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
