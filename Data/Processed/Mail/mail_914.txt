Hello Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble setting specific role permissions within a Mercury language script. I've defined roles in the IAM service, but I can't seem to access the correct context within the script to enforce them. 

Is there a specific library or function I need to use from the IAM service within my Mercury code to achieve this? 

Thanks,
John Doe
