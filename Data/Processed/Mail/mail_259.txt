Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* Error messages: "Resource Limit Exceeded: vCPU quota exceeded" and "Deployment Failed: Unable to provision instances." 
* Deployment configuration: I've attached the relevant section. 
* Timestamps: Most recent attempt failed at 2023-10-26T12:00:00Z. Several attempts yesterday between 14:00Z and 18:00Z also failed. 
* Cloud resource changes: No recent changes have been made.

We are also experiencing some latency spikes in our API. Could this be related to the deployment issue?

Thank you,
John Smith
