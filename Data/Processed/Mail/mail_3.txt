We are experiencing critical issues with user permissions on our production API (API key: aeth-prod-28374). Users with the correct roles are being denied access to endpoints they should have access to. This is causing major disruption to our services. We need immediate assistance to resolve this.

We believe the issue might be related to recent changes we made in the IAM service regarding role assignments. We can provide more details on the specific roles and endpoints affected if needed.
