Aetheros Support, 

The issue seems to be resolved now. Our API calls are authenticating successfully.

However, this outage was highly disruptive to our operations. We rely heavily on your services, and such incidents are unacceptable. We expect a thorough post-mortem on this bug and preventative measures to avoid such occurrences in the future.

Regards,
John Doe
