Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent high latency on our /products API endpoint. This endpoint was developed by your team using the Mercury language.

The latency spikes seem to occur randomly and last for a few hours before returning to normal. We've checked our end, and everything seems to be fine.

We're using your API monitoring platform and can see the latency spikes reflected there. Could you please help us investigate and resolve this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
