Hello John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. While the current version of the API Monitoring dashboard doesn't allow for custom widget arrangements, we understand this is a desired feature.

We've forwarded your request to our development team for consideration in future updates. We appreciate your feedback!

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
