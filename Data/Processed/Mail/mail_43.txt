Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having some trouble figuring out how to best handle data type conversions in Mercury. Specifically, I'm trying to convert a string representation of a date and time to a format I can use for calculations. 

Could you point me to any relevant documentation or examples? 

Thanks,
John Doe
