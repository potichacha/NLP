Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand the urgency of this issue and are looking into the latency spikes you're experiencing with your production API.

To assist us in our investigation, could you please provide the following information:

* Approximate timeframes when the latency spikes occurred.
* Any specific API endpoints that were particularly affected.
* Screenshots from the Aetheros monitoring dashboard during the time of the incidents, if available.

Once we have this information, we'll be able to investigate further and provide you with more specific guidance.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
