Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing an urgent issue where our deployments are failing due to what seems like a misconfigured security group in our Cloud Management environment. 

Specifically, instances are unable to reach our database server. We believe the security group attached to our database instance may be blocking traffic from the application instances.

We also need to immediately add a new user to our IAM service with specific access to manage only the cloud resources, but the IAM interface seems to be unresponsive.

Could you please investigate this as a top priority?

Thanks,
John Doe
