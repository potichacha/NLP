Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.

We understand you're experiencing difficulties deploying a Mercury lambda function to your managed cloud environment. To assist you effectively, could you please provide the following information:

* The approximate time and date of the failed deployments.
* The region where your cloud environment is located.
* The error message you received, if any.
* A code snippet of your Mercury lambda function (if possible).

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
