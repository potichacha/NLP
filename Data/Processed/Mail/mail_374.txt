Dear Isabella,

Thank you for reaching out and for your suggestion regarding WebSocket support for our API development services. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us.

We understand the growing need for real-time capabilities in web applications. While we don't currently offer native WebSocket support, we are constantly evaluating new technologies and solutions to enhance our offerings. 

We have taken note of your suggestion and will keep it in mind as we plan for future development. We will be sure to share it with our product team for their consideration.

In the meantime, you might be interested in exploring alternative approaches for real-time communication within our existing framework.  We encourage you to check our documentation for potential workarounds.

Thank you again for your valuable feedback.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
