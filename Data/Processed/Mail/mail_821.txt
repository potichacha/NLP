Hello Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing a critical issue with API response times for the API you developed for us. Since yesterday evening, response times have increased drastically, causing significant disruption to our services.

We are currently seeing response times of over 60 seconds, which is unacceptable for our real-time application. We have checked our end for any potential issues, and everything seems to be functioning correctly.

We need this resolved urgently. Please advise on the next steps and expected resolution time.

Sincerely,
John Doe
