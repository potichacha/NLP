We are experiencing critical issues with the Mercury language compiler in our production environment. Our entire development team is at a standstill because of compilation errors that are nonsensical and we cannot trace. This is a major blocker for us and we need immediate assistance. We have tried restarting services, reinstalling the compiler, and checking for any code conflicts but nothing has resolved the issue.

Please advise on how to proceed urgently. Project 'Orion' is completely halted until this is resolved.
