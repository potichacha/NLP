Dear Isiah,

Thank you for reaching out and providing this valuable feedback on our Mercury documentation. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your suggestions.

We agree that expanding the error handling and IAM role sections would be incredibly beneficial for our users. Your points are well-taken, and we've added these topics to our documentation roadmap for prioritization. 

We'll keep you updated on the progress of incorporating these improvements. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or suggestions.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
