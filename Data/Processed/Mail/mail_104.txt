Hi John,

We checked with our team, and currently, we don't have a way to set different API rate limits based on individual IAM roles. You can manage overall API usage limits, but it wouldn't be at the granularity you're looking for. 

Let us know if you have any other questions.

Best Regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
