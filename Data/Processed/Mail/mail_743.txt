Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest a potentially valuable integration between the Mercury language and your Cloud Management service.

Currently, while Mercury streamlines our API development, deploying those APIs through the Cloud Management platform still requires switching contexts and using different tools. It would significantly improve our workflow if we could define our cloud infrastructure and deployment pipelines directly within our Mercury codebase.

Imagine being able to write Mercury code that not only defines our API endpoints but also specifies the cloud resources needed, scaling parameters, and even deployment triggers. This would streamline our entire development-to-deployment process, making it more efficient and less prone to errors.

Is this something that Aetheros would consider? I believe this integration would greatly benefit many developers using both Mercury and your Cloud Management services.

Thanks,
Isiah Schmeler
