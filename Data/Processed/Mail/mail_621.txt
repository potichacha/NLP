Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out and providing valuable feedback on our API monitoring solution. We understand the inconvenience caused by the sensitive default alert threshold for latency spikes. 

We appreciate your suggestion to add customizable threshold settings. I've forwarded your request to our product team for further consideration. We're always striving to improve our product offerings based on user feedback.

In the meantime, would you mind sharing more details about your use case and the ideal latency spike threshold you have in mind? This will help our product team better assess your requirements.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
