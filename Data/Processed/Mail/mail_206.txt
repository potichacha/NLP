Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm experiencing an issue with asynchronous function calls in Mercury.  The async keyword doesn't seem to be working as expected, and my code is executing sequentially instead of concurrently.

Could you please help me understand why this might be happening? I've attached a code snippet demonstrating the issue.

Thanks,
John Doe
