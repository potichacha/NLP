Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand the urgency of this issue and are here to help.

To assist us in diagnosing the problem, could you please provide the following information:

*  The specific version of the Mercury Language SDK you are using.
*  A code snippet demonstrating how you are integrating Mercury with the IAM service.
*  The relevant IAM role configurations and permissions.

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution. 

In the meantime, you can refer to our documentation on Mercury Language and IAM integration here: [link to documentation]

We will keep you updated on the progress.

Best regards,

Aetheros Support Team
