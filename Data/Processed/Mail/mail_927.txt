Hi John,

We have identified the issue and are working on a fix. We will keep you updated on the progress.

In the meantime, as a workaround, you can try assigning the role through the API using the following endpoint:

```
POST /api/v1/users/{userId}/roles
```

Please let us know if you encounter any difficulties with this workaround.

Regards,
Aetheros Support
