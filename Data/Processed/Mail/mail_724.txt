Dear Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement to the error handling mechanisms within the Mercury language. While developing an API using Mercury, I've noticed that the error messages could be more descriptive, especially when dealing with complex API interactions.

For instance, when an API call fails, it would be incredibly helpful if the error message provided more context about the specific endpoint, parameters used, and potentially even a stack trace for debugging purposes.

I believe that enhancing the error handling in this way would significantly improve the developer experience and speed up the debugging process.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Sincerely,
Isabella Ross
