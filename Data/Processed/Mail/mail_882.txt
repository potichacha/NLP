Hello John,

We've investigated the issue, and it appears there might be a known bug in the version of Mercury you are using related to concurrency. We recommend upgrading to the latest version, 1.3.1, which includes a fix for this issue.

Please let us know if you encounter any further problems after upgrading.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
