* **Error Message:** "Mercury Runtime Error (Code: 1248): Unable to initialize connection pool. Invalid credentials provided." 
* **Mercury Language Version:** 2.1.5 
* **Recent Changes:** We updated our authentication service to use a new API key for increased security. This new key is being used in the API deployment.

We suspect the issue might be related to the new API key not being properly propagated to the cloud environment. However, we've double-checked our configuration and everything seems to be in order.
