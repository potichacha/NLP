Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing two critical issues with our Aetheros services:

1. **API Monitoring Dashboard Not Updating:** Our API monitoring dashboard has stopped updating in real-time. We are not receiving any new data or alerts, making it impossible to monitor our API performance effectively.

2. **Cloud Instance Unresponsive:** One of our cloud instances managed by Aetheros has become unresponsive. We cannot access the instance or any of the applications hosted on it.

These issues are severely impacting our operations. Please investigate and provide an update as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
John Doe
