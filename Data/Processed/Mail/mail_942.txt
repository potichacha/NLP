Dear Isiah,

You are absolutely correct! There was a minor syntax error in your JSON payload. The extra double quote after `john.doe@example.com` was causing the compilation error.

Here's the corrected code snippet:

```mercury
api.post("/users", {
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
})
```

Please make this change, and your code should compile successfully. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this oversight.

Let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
