Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We understand the urgency of your situation and are here to help.

We have received your request to reset your IAM credentials and are currently processing it. You should receive a password reset link within the next hour.  In the meantime, we have temporarily suspended your account access as a security precaution.

Regarding the discrepancies in your cloud resources bill, we will need some time to investigate this further. A member of our billing team will contact you directly within the next 24 hours to discuss this in detail.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support
