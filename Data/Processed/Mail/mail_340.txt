Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm experiencing an issue with the async functionality in Mercury. When I try to use the 'await' keyword, the code seems to be executing sequentially rather than asynchronously. This is causing significant performance issues in my application.

I've tried reviewing the documentation and searching your forums, but haven't found a solution yet. Could you please help me understand what I might be doing wrong?

Here's a snippet of the code I'm using:

```mercury
let response = await http.get("https://example.com/api/data");
log(response);
```

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
John Doe
