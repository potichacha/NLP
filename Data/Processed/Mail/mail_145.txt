Dear John,

Thank you for providing the additional details. Based on the information you've shared, we recommend exploring the following optimization strategies:

1. **Vertical Scaling:** Consider upgrading your m5.large instances to a more powerful instance type within the M5 family, such as m5.xlarge or m5.2xlarge. This can provide more CPU and memory resources to handle peak loads.
2. **Auto Scaling:** Implement AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on real-time demand. You can configure Auto Scaling policies to automatically add instances during peak hours and remove them when traffic subsides.
3. **Load Balancing:** Utilize AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances. This helps prevent any single instance from becoming overwhelmed and improves application availability.

We recommend testing these strategies in a staging environment before deploying them to production to ensure they meet your specific performance requirements.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or require additional assistance. We're here to help!

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
