Hi Aetheros Support,

We're receiving alerts from your API Monitoring platform indicating significant downtime for our application's main API. However, our internal monitoring and user activity suggest everything is functioning as expected.

Could you please investigate this discrepancy urgently as we rely heavily on your monitoring for accurate outage detection?

Application Name: MyWebApp
API Endpoint: https://api.mywebapp.com/v1

Thanks,
John Doe
