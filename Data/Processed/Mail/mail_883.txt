We are experiencing a critical issue with the Aetheros API Monitoring service. We have configured alerts to trigger on any changes made to a specific IAM role that has access to sensitive data. However, we recently observed unauthorized changes to this role, and no alerts were generated by the API Monitoring system.

This is a major security concern for us, and we need this resolved immediately. Please investigate this issue with the highest priority and advise on next steps.
