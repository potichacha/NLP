Hello Isiah,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand you're facing scaling challenges with your application. To assist you effectively, could you please provide us with more details about your current cloud configuration, including:

* Instance types and sizes
* Autoscaling policies configured
* Database specifications
* Approximate traffic volume during peak hours

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and suggest optimization strategies. 

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
