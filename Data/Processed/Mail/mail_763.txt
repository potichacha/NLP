Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out.  To help us pinpoint the cause of the scaling issues, could you please provide some additional details?

* Which specific cloud provider and region are you using?
* Have you made any recent changes to your application or API configurations?
* Could you share any relevant logs or monitoring data that illustrate the slow response times?

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide more tailored guidance.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
