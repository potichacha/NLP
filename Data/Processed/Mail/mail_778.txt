Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out. We've investigated the intermittent latency spikes you reported and haven't found any systemic issues on our end. To help us further diagnose the problem, could you please provide the following information?

* Approximate times and dates of the latency spikes
* Any specific endpoints or API calls affected
* Screenshots of the latency spikes from your monitoring dashboard

This information will help us pinpoint the source of the issue. 

Best Regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
