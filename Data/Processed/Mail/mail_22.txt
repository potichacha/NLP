Thanks for the reply. I understand that rate limiting is not currently supported within Cloud Management itself. 

Can you please elaborate on how I can use the API monitoring features to set up alerts for potential rate limiting scenarios? Ideally, I'd like to be notified if API requests from a specific origin exceed a certain threshold within a given timeframe.

Is this something that can be configured through the API monitoring dashboard, or would it require a more custom solution?

Thanks again,
Isiah
