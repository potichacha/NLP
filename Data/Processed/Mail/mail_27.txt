Hi Aetheros Support Team,

I've been using your API monitoring platform for a few months now, and it's been incredibly helpful in tracking our API performance. However, I have a suggestion for the dashboard.

Currently, the response time graph only shows the average response time. It would be extremely beneficial if we could also visualize the minimum, maximum, and perhaps even percentiles of response times directly on the graph. This would provide a much clearer picture of performance fluctuations and potential bottlenecks.

Thanks for considering this suggestion.

Sincerely,
John Doe
