Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support. We understand you are experiencing critical issues with our services. 

To help us investigate, could you please provide us with the following information:

* Your Aetheros account ID

* Any recent changes made to your API or cloud infrastructure

We will investigate this further and get back to you as soon as possible.

Best regards,
