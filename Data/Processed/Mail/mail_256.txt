Hi John,

We have identified the issue. There was a bug in our latest release that caused some IAM permissions to not be applied correctly under certain circumstances. We have already deployed a fix for this issue. 

Can you please confirm if the issue is resolved on your end?

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
