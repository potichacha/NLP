To help us investigate this issue further, could you please provide us with some additional information:

* Can you please describe the specific roles and permissions involved?
* What steps have you already taken to try to resolve the issue?
* Are all users affected, or just a specific group?

Once we have this information, we'll be able to assist you more effectively.

Best regards,
