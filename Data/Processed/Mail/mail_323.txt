We are experiencing critical issues with API access. Our applications are being denied access despite having the correct IAM roles assigned. This is causing a major disruption to our services. 

We have verified the following:

- The IAM roles have the necessary permissions.
- The roles are correctly attached to the instances.
- There are no network connectivity issues.

We have also checked the API monitoring dashboard, but it doesn't show any unusual spikes or errors that could explain this. 

Please advise on how to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
