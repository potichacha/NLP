Hello Isabella,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. We apologize for the missing documentation regarding asynchronous function calls in Mercury language.

We are currently updating our documentation portal. In the meantime, could you please provide a code snippet of what you're trying to achieve? This will help us understand your specific use case and guide you better. 

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
