Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble deploying my Mercury code to the Aetheros Cloud. I'm getting a generic error message that doesn't provide any helpful information.

Here's what I've tried so far:
- Double-checked my code for errors
- Verified my cloud resource configurations
- Restarted my deployment pipeline

Nothing seems to be working. Could you please help me resolve this issue as soon as possible?

Thanks,
John Doe
