Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. 

We understand you are facing difficulties integrating Mercury language functions with our IAM service and seeing inconsistencies in the API monitoring dashboard. This is certainly not the experience we want you to have.

To help us investigate this further, could you please provide us with the following information?

* The specific version of the Mercury language and IAM service you are using
* A code snippet demonstrating how you are defining the API endpoint and attempting to enforce IAM roles
* Screenshots of the inconsistencies you are observing on the API monitoring dashboard

Once we have this information, we will be able to assist you more effectively. 

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
