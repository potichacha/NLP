Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing a critical issue with our API monitoring dashboard. It hasn't updated in the last hour, and we're also unable to access our main cloud instance. This is causing a major disruption to our services.

We suspect a potential issue with IAM permissions following a recent role update. Could you please investigate this urgently?

Best,
John Doe
