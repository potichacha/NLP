Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement regarding the deployment process of Mercury Language applications on your cloud platform. Currently, the deployment process, while functional, feels a bit cumbersome and could benefit from some streamlining.

Specifically, I believe integrating automated resource provisioning based on the Mercury application's configuration files would significantly speed up deployment. This would allow developers to define their infrastructure needs directly within their code, making the deployment process smoother and less prone to manual errors.

Furthermore, incorporating a feature within the Mercury language itself to specify deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production) would be incredibly beneficial. This would enable developers to manage environment-specific configurations more efficiently and ensure consistent deployments across different stages.

I believe these enhancements would greatly improve the developer experience and streamline the cloud deployment workflow for Mercury applications.

Thank you for considering my suggestions.

Sincerely,
Isiah Schmeler
