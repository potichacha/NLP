Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some performance issues with our application, particularly during peak hours. We suspect it might be related to our cloud resource scaling configuration. 

We are currently using your Cloud Management service and are on the Basic plan. Could you advise on best practices for instance optimization to improve our application's responsiveness?

Thanks,
John Doe
