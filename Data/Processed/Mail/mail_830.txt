Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* API endpoint URL: https://api.example.com/v1/auth
* Timeframes: We noticed the spikes yesterday between 14:00 and 15:00 UTC, and again today between 08:00 and 08:30 UTC.
* Error messages: We didn't encounter any specific error messages, just increased response times.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
John Doe
