To Aetheros Support,

This is becoming increasingly critical as our systems rely heavily on these APIs. The delay is causing significant disruption.  

Here's the information you requested:

* **API Key ID:**  API-0012987X
* **Error Message:** 'Invalid API Key'  (This error appears even after waiting for the specified propagation time).
* **Steps to Reproduce:** 
 1. Log in to the Aetheros IAM dashboard.
 2. Navigate to the API Key section.
 3. Select the key to rotate (API-0012987X in this case).
 4. Click on 'Rotate Key'.
 5.  Wait for the specified time for the new key to become active. 
 6. Use the new key in my application.

Please look into this urgently and provide a solution ASAP. 

Regards,
John Doe
