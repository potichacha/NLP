Dear John,

Thank you for your email and for your suggestion regarding the API Monitoring dashboard. We appreciate your feedback and value your input.

We understand the importance of having a comprehensive view of API performance, and we agree that displaying the minimum and maximum response times would be a valuable addition to the dashboard.

We have forwarded your suggestion to our product team for consideration in future updates.

In the meantime, please let us know if you have any other questions or feedback.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
