Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent high latency with the API you developed for us. The issue started about a week ago and has been occurring more frequently.

We're seeing response times of over 5 seconds at times, which is impacting our application's performance.

We've checked our end, and there doesn't seem to be any issue on our side.

Could you please investigate this issue as soon as possible and let us know what the problem is?

Thanks,
John Doe
