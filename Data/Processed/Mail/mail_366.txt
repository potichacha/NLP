Dear Isabella,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We understand you're experiencing intermittent 502 errors with your new API endpoint (`/api/v2/products`). We're here to help!

To assist us in diagnosing the issue, could you please provide us with the following information:

* **Timeframe:** When did these errors start occurring?
* **Frequency:** How often are you encountering these 502 errors?
* **Request details:** Could you share a sample request (headers and body) that triggers the error?
* **Error logs:**  Please provide any relevant error logs from your application or server.

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
