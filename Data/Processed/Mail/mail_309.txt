Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working on a project using Mercury language to build APIs, and I'm having some trouble understanding how to best integrate with your IAM service for authorization.

Specifically, I'm looking for documentation or examples on how to:

1.  Retrieve and validate user tokens within a Mercury API function.
2.  Enforce role-based access control to specific API endpoints or resources based on the user's IAM role.

Could you please point me in the right direction?

Thanks,
Isabella Wilson
