Hello Aetheros Support,

We are facing a critical issue with compiling our Mercury language codebase during API deployment. We are receiving a 'Symbol not found' error, but we have double-checked all dependencies and the symbol is definitely defined. 

This is blocking our entire deployment pipeline and impacting our production environment. Could you please provide urgent assistance?

Our API ID is: api-7890987-na
Mercury version: 1.2.5

Thanks,
Isiah Terry
