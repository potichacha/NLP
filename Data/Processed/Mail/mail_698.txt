Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working with the Mercury language for a new API endpoint, and I'm a bit stuck on something in the documentation. I couldn't find a clear answer on how to handle asynchronous calls within a specific Mercury code block.

Could you point me to the right resource or provide a quick example? 

Thanks,
Isiah Schmeler
