Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest a potentially valuable addition to the Mercury language: built-in support for async/await syntax. 

As you know, handling asynchronous operations effectively is crucial for modern web applications, particularly when interacting with APIs or performing I/O-bound tasks.  Async/await patterns have become a standard in many languages for writing asynchronous code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain compared to traditional callback-based approaches.

Implementing async/await in Mercury would significantly improve developer productivity and code quality for applications built using your framework.  

I'd be happy to discuss this suggestion further and provide more specific examples of how this feature could be implemented and the benefits it would bring.

Thanks,
Isabella Davis
