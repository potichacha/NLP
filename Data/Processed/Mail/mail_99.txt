Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working with the Mercury language for a new API project, and I'm having trouble finding clear documentation on how to implement rate limiting within the language itself. Is there a specific library or module I should be using, or is this handled through a different Aetheros service?

Thanks,
John Doe
