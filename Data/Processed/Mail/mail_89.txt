Dear John,

Our engineers have identified the issue. There was a misconfiguration in the auto-scaling settings of your load balancer following the deployment of your API v2.3. This has been rectified, and your API should now be accessible. 

We apologize for the inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience.

We'll be in touch shortly to schedule a follow-up to discuss this further and prevent similar issues in the future.

Best Regards,
Aetheros Support Team
