Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing significant issues with both the cloud management and API monitoring services over the past few days. Our cloud costs have inexplicably skyrocketed, and we're seeing major latency spikes with our primary API during peak hours.

We need urgent assistance in identifying the root cause of these issues and implementing a solution. Please advise on the next steps to resolve this as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
John Doe
