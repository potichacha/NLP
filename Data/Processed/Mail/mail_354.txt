Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm encountering some difficulties integrating Mercury with our existing API. Specifically, I'm struggling with data serialization between our API (built with Python/Django) and a new microservice we're developing using Mercury. 

Could you provide some guidance or documentation on best practices for this type of integration? Any examples showcasing data exchange between Mercury and Python would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks,
John Doe
