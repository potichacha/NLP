Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement to the API monitoring service. While the real-time monitoring is useful, it would be incredibly helpful if you could implement a customizable alerting system that triggers based on specific thresholds or patterns in the API response data.

For instance, being able to set an alert for when a specific endpoint's response time exceeds a defined limit or if a particular error code appears frequently would be extremely beneficial for proactive issue identification and resolution.

Thanks for considering this suggestion.

Sincerely,
John Doe
