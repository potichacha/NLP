Hi Aetheros Support,

I've been using your API Monitoring service for a few months now and I'm really happy with it overall. However, I have a suggestion that I think would make the dashboard even better.

Currently, the response time graph only shows the average response time. It would be really helpful if it could also display the minimum and maximum response times for the selected period. This would allow us to quickly identify any outliers and get a better understanding of the overall performance of our APIs.

Thanks for considering my suggestion.

Sincerely,
John Doe
