Dear Aetheros Support Team,

I'm writing to suggest some enhancements for the error handling in your API development services.

While I find the overall API development experience quite good, I believe providing more detailed error messages and standardized error codes would be incredibly helpful. This would make it much easier for developers to troubleshoot and debug integrations.

For instance, instead of a generic 500 error, a more specific code indicating the nature of the issue (e.g., database connection error, authorization failure) would be highly beneficial. Additionally, including relevant details in the error message, such as the specific database query or configuration parameter that caused the issue, would further expedite the debugging process.

I believe implementing these improvements would significantly enhance the developer experience and streamline the integration process.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Sincerely,
Isabella Wilson
