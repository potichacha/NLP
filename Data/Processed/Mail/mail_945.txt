Hi Aetheros Team,

Thank you for your prompt response and willingness to help. We are expecting a large scale for our e-commerce platform and we require robust security measures to protect sensitive user data. Can you provide some examples of how you have addressed these requirements in previous projects?  

Additionally, we are particularly interested in understanding your approach to API versioning and how you ensure backward compatibility.

Thanks,
Harvey
