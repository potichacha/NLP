Dear John,

Our engineers have identified the issue and implemented a fix. The problem stemmed from an outdated IAM role permission that was preventing the deployment of new instances. 

We have updated the role with the correct permissions, and your auto-scaling configuration should now function as expected.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
