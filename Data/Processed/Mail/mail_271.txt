Hi,

Here's the information you requested:

* Account ID: 87654321
* APIs affected: All APIs under the "products" endpoint
* Timestamps: Issue started around 07:00 UTC.  Error message: "429 Too Many Requests"

We also noticed some inconsistencies in the user access logs within the IAM service around the same timeframe. We suspect there might be a connection. 

Let me know if you require further details. This is impacting our business operations significantly.

Thanks,
John
