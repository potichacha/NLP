Hi Aetheros Support,

I've been working with Mercury for the past few months and have been really impressed with how it streamlines API development. However, I noticed a few areas in the documentation that I believe could be improved for clarity and completeness.

Specifically, I think it would be beneficial to:

1. **Expand on the section about error handling in Mercury.**  A more detailed explanation of common error types and how to implement robust error handling would be incredibly helpful.
2. **Provide more practical examples of using IAM roles within Mercury code.** While the basic concepts are covered, having more real-world scenarios illustrated would greatly enhance understanding.

I'm confident that these additions would make the Mercury documentation even more valuable to developers like myself. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Isiah Wuckert
