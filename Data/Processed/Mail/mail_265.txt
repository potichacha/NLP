Dear John,

We have identified the root cause of the issue. The security group attached to the new VPC was blocking access to S3. We have updated the security group rules, and the permissions for 'DataProcessingRole' should now be applied correctly.

Can you please confirm if the issue is resolved on your end?

We apologize for the inconvenience caused. 

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
