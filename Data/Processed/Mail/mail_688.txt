We are experiencing a critical issue with our Aetheros integration. We are unable to authenticate API calls made using the Mercury language SDK with the IAM service.  This is causing a complete outage of our system.  We have verified that our API keys are correct and that the IAM service is running.  We have also checked the Mercury documentation and haven't found any solutions.  Please advise on how to resolve this issue ASAP.
