Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.

We understand you're experiencing a Null Pointer Exception while accessing your database within a Mercury lambda function. This typically occurs when the `Database.connect` method cannot establish a connection using the provided connection string. 

To help us diagnose the issue further, could you please provide the following information?

* **Full error message and stack trace:** This will give us more context on where the exception is originating. 
* **Code for the `Database.connect` method:**  Please share the code you're using to establish the database connection. 
* **Confirmation that your database is reachable:** Can you confirm that your database is up and running and that you can connect to it outside of the Mercury lambda environment?

Once we have this information, we'll be able to assist you further. 

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
