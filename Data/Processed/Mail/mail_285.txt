Dear John,

Thank you for your email and your valuable suggestion regarding granular role inheritance in our IAM service. We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback and use case with us.

We understand the need for more fine-grained control over role permissions, and we agree that it would enhance both security and management capabilities. We've been researching different approaches to implementing a more robust and flexible inheritance model.

We've added your suggestion to our feature request list and will prioritize it based on user demand and feasibility. While we cannot provide a specific timeline for implementation, we will keep you updated on any progress.

In the meantime, would you be open to a quick call to discuss your specific use case and explore potential workarounds within the existing IAM framework?

Best Regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
