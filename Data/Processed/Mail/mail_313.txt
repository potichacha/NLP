Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* Account ID: [Redacted - Example Account ID]
* API Endpoints: Primarily affecting `/api/v2/processOrder` and `/api/v2/getUserData`
* Screenshots: [Attached Screenshots]

We're also noticing some unusual behavior with our Mercury language scripts used in these API endpoints. We suspect there might be a connection. 

Please let us know if you need anything else.

John
