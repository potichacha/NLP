Dear Isiah,

Thank you for your interest in Aetheros IAM. We appreciate you reaching out.

To answer your question, yes, our IAM service supports role inheritance. You can define parent roles with specific permissions and create child roles that inherit those permissions. Child roles can also have additional, specific permissions that are not granted to the parent role.

For detailed information and examples, please refer to our documentation on role-based access control: [link to documentation]

Let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
