Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble deploying a function written in Mercury Language. It seems to be getting stuck in the 'Deploying' state, and I'm not seeing any error messages in the logs.

Can you help me troubleshoot this?

Function name: processOrder
Environment: Production

Thanks,
John Doe
