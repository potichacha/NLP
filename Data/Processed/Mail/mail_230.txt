Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support.

We understand the urgency of the issues you're facing with our IAM service and Mercury deployment. We have escalated your case to our senior engineers.

To help us diagnose the problem more effectively, could you please provide us with the following information:

* **For the IAM issue:**
    * The specific roles you are trying to assign.
    * The error message you are receiving.
    * Screenshots of the steps you are taking to assign the roles.
* **For the Mercury deployment issue:**
    * The version of Mercury you are using.
    * The deployment logs from your most recent attempt.
    * Your cloud environment configuration files (if possible).

Once we have received this information, we will investigate further and provide an update as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
