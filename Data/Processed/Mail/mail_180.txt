Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent high latency issues with the API you developed for us. These latency spikes are significantly impacting our application performance and user experience.

We've checked our end, and the issue seems to originate from the API side. Could you investigate this urgently and provide an update?

Best regards,
John Doe
