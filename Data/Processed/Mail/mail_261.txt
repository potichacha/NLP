Hi Aetheros Support,

Thank you for the update. We have submitted a request for a vCPU quota increase.

Regarding the API latency, we will monitor it closely and provide you with the requested details if the issue persists after the deployment is resolved.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
John Smith
