Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm encountering an unexpected type error while working with Mercury language in my project. 

Specifically, I'm getting an error that says "Type mismatch: expected 'String', got 'Integer'" when trying to pass an integer value to a function that expects a string. 

I've double-checked my code and the function definition, and everything seems correct according to the documentation.

Could you please help me understand why this error is occurring and how to resolve it?

Thanks,
John Doe
