Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand that managing cloud costs is important, and we're here to help.

We can definitely provide you with a more detailed breakdown of your resource usage.  You can access this information directly through the Aetheros platform dashboard.  Navigate to the 'Billing & Usage' section, and you'll find tools to analyze your spending by service, time period, and more.

If you're having trouble finding something specific or need further assistance, let us know.

Best regards,
