We are experiencing a critical issue with our application following an update to our IAM roles. 

Since the update, users are unable to authenticate through our API, resulting in a complete outage of our services. We have verified that the API credentials are correct and that the issue started immediately after the IAM role changes.

We require urgent assistance in resolving this issue as it is impacting our production environment. Please advise on the next steps to troubleshoot and resolve this problem as soon as possible.
