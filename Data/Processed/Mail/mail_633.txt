Hello John,

You can definitely control access to specific API endpoints based on user roles using our IAM service. You don't need to manage this directly in your API code.

We have detailed documentation on how to set up role-based access control for your APIs within our IAM service: [link to documentation]

Feel free to ask if you have any more questions.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
