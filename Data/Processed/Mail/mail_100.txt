Hello John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support. 

You are correct, detailed documentation regarding rate limiting within the Mercury language itself is currently limited. While we work on expanding our documentation, the most efficient way to implement rate limiting for your API is through our API monitoring service. It provides robust tools to set and manage rate limits directly, without needing to build them from scratch within your Mercury code.

You can find more information about setting up rate limits with our API monitoring service in our knowledge base here: [link to documentation]

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
