Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing critical issues with our cloud instance scaling. Our application, built using Mercury language, is failing to deploy new instances during peak hours. 

We have checked our resource limits and they seem sufficient. We suspect there might be an issue with the auto-scaling configuration or a potential conflict with our IAM roles related to deployment permissions.

Could you please investigate this urgently? This is impacting our production environment and causing significant disruption.

Thanks,
John Doe
