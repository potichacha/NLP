Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing two critical issues with our Aetheros services:

1. **Cloud Costs Exploding:** Our cloud costs have spiked dramatically in the last 24 hours, far exceeding typical usage patterns. We haven't deployed any major changes recently, so we're unsure what's causing this sudden increase.

2. **API Monitoring Down:**  Our API monitoring dashboard has been offline for the past few hours. We're completely blind to the performance and health of our APIs. This is a major concern as it impacts our ability to identify and resolve issues quickly.

We need immediate assistance to diagnose and resolve these problems. Please advise on the next steps.

Sincerely,
John Doe
