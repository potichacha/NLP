Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out to us. We understand that you're experiencing latency issues on your staging server, and we're here to help.

To better assist you, could you please provide us with the following information?

* Approximate times and dates when the latency spikes occurred
* Any error messages or logs you've encountered
* Details about your staging environment (e.g., instance size, region)

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution.

Best regards,
