Dear John,

We have identified the issue causing the false positives. It was related to a recent update to our monitoring system that introduced a bug in how 500 errors were being reported for certain endpoint configurations.

We have implemented a fix and confirmed that the false positives have stopped. 

We sincerely apologize for the disruption this caused. We are committed to providing you with the best possible service and are taking steps to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

Please let us know if you experience any further issues.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
