We are experiencing a critical issue with the API monitoring service. We are receiving a large number of false positive alerts, indicating our API is down when it is not. This is causing significant confusion and disruption as we are having to manually verify each alert.  We rely heavily on your service for real-time monitoring, and this issue is impacting our live service and customer experience. Please advise on a resolution as soon as possible.

Regards,
John Smith
