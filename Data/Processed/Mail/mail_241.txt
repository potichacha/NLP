Dear Aetheros Support Team,

We are experiencing critical issues with API latency since this morning. Our monitoring dashboards, connected to your API Monitoring service, show sporadic yet severe latency spikes affecting multiple API endpoints.

These spikes are causing service disruptions and impacting our customers. We need immediate assistance in identifying the root cause and resolving this issue.

We have already checked our internal systems and network infrastructure, but everything appears to be functioning normally. We suspect the problem might be related to your API Monitoring service or its integration with our systems.

Please investigate this issue urgently and provide an update as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
John Doe
Head of Engineering
