Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble deploying a Mercury language application on the Aetheros Cloud platform. I've followed the documentation, but I keep encountering an error during the deployment process. 

The error message isn't very descriptive, and I'm not sure how to proceed. Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this?

Here are the details of my environment:
- Aetheros Cloud account: john.doe@example.com
- Mercury language version: 1.2.3
- Deployment region: us-east-1

Thanks in advance for your help,
John Doe
