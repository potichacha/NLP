Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm having trouble setting specific role permissions within the Mercury language for a new API I'm developing. I've defined roles in the IAM service, but I can't seem to link them effectively within the Mercury code. 

Is there specific syntax I'm missing, or is there a discrepancy between the IAM service and Mercury language integration?

Thanks,
John Doe
