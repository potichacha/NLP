Dear John,

Our engineers have identified the issue and applied a fix. You should now be able to access your production environment using the `prod-admin` role.

The problem stemmed from a caching issue following the role update. We apologize for the inconvenience caused by this outage.

We will conduct a thorough post-mortem to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

If you face any further issues, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support
