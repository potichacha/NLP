Hi,

Here is the information you requested:

* We have three roles: 'Administrator', 'Manager', and 'Viewer'. 'Administrator' should inherit permissions from 'Manager', and 'Manager' from 'Viewer'. The issue is that 'Administrator' users are not inheriting the 'Read' permission assigned to the 'Viewer' role.
* We have double-checked our role hierarchy configuration and tested with different users, but the problem persists.
* The issue affects all users assigned to the 'Administrator' role.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,
John
