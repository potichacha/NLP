Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand you're facing difficulties with automatic scaling. To assist you better, could you please provide us with the following information:

* Your Aetheros account ID
* A brief description of your scaling configuration
* The approximate time and date you experienced the traffic spikes

Once we have this information, we can investigate further and provide a solution.

Regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
