Hello Aetheros Support Team,

I'm encountering a critical error when trying to compile my Mercury code, specifically related to my API integration.  The error message is vague, and I haven't been able to pinpoint the cause.

Here's the error message I'm getting: "Mercury compilation error: Unexpected token '"'"

I'm using the latest version of the Mercury SDK and have followed the documentation closely.  I'm hoping you can provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Isiah Schmeler
