Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We've been experiencing intermittent high latency with our API that's connected to your API monitoring service for the past few hours.  This is causing significant performance degradation for our users. 

We've checked our end and everything seems to be functioning correctly. Can you please investigate this issue urgently and provide an update?

Thanks,
John Doe
