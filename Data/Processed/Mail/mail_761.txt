Hi,

I'm trying to integrate with your API platform and manage user access using Aetheros IAM. Specifically, I need to understand how to:

1. Verify user tokens within a Mercury application.
2. Authorize users based on their roles defined in Aetheros IAM.

Can you provide any examples or updated documentation snippets related to this?

Regards,
John
