Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing issues with our API monitoring setup. Specifically, we're not receiving alerts when there are changes to IAM roles within our application.

We heavily rely on these alerts to maintain security and audit trails. This lack of notification is a serious concern for us.

Could you please investigate this issue urgently and provide an update as soon as possible?

Thanks,
John Doe
