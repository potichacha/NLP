Hi Aetheros Support,

I've gathered the information you requested:

1. **Error Message:**  "Invalid or expired token" - this is consistent across all attempts.
2. **Code Snippet:** I've attached a separate file containing the relevant code snippet.  Please note that due to security policies, I cannot share our complete codebase.
3. **Mercury SDK Version:** 2.3.5

We are hoping for a prompt resolution as this is impacting our production timeline.

Thank you,
John Doe
