Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.

There is no hard limit on the number of roles you can create within our IAM service. However, for performance and manageability reasons, we recommend keeping the number of roles to a reasonable level.

We have a comprehensive documentation section on managing roles within our IAM service, including best practices for handling a large number of roles:

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support
