Hi John,

Thank you for your interest in Aetheros! We're happy to provide more information about Mercury and its integration with our IAM service.

Mercury simplifies RBAC implementation through its declarative syntax and built-in security features. You can define roles and permissions directly within your API code using annotations and decorators. These definitions are then enforced by the Aetheros runtime, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific API endpoints or resources.

Mercury provides dedicated libraries for interacting with the Aetheros IAM service. These libraries offer functions for retrieving user roles, checking permissions, and managing authentication tokens. This tight integration allows for streamlined RBAC implementation within your Mercury code.

For code examples and detailed documentation, please visit our documentation portal at [link to documentation]. You'll find a comprehensive guide on using Mercury and Aetheros IAM for secure API development.

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions.

Best regards,
Aetheros Support Team
