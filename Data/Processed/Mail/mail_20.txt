Hi Aetheros Support,

We are currently using your Cloud Management service and are very happy with the features and performance. However, we're looking to implement rate limiting on some of our APIs that are managed by Aetheros Cloud Management. 

Could you please provide some information on how we can achieve this? Is there built-in functionality within the Cloud Management platform for API rate limiting, or are there recommended third-party tools that integrate well with your system?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
Isiah Rippin
