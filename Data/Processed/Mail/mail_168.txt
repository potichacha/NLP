Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working on integrating our Mercury-based API with the Aetheros IAM service. We're encountering an issue where the API doesn't seem to be properly recognizing the roles assigned to users through the IAM. 

Specifically, users who should have access to certain API endpoints based on their roles are getting denied access. Could you please provide some guidance on how to troubleshoot this?

Thanks,
John Doe
