Dear John,

Thank you for contacting Aetheros Support.

We understand you are experiencing difficulties integrating IAM roles within your Mercury script. To better assist you, could you please provide us with the following information:

* A snippet of your Mercury code where you are attempting to implement the role-based permissions.
* The specific error message or unexpected behavior you are encountering.
* The versions of the Mercury language and IAM service you are currently using.

Once we have this information, we can investigate the issue further and provide you with a solution.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
