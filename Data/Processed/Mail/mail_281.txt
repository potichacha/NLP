Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm working on a project using Mercury and I have a couple of questions.

Firstly, I'm having a hard time understanding how to implement custom rate limiting for an API endpoint defined in Mercury. Is there specific documentation or examples I could refer to?

Secondly, is it possible to view real-time API usage metrics within the IAM service dashboard? I need to track which users are making the most requests.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
Miguel Rodriguez
