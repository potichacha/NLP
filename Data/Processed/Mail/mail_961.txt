We are experiencing critical compiler errors with the Mercury language in our production environment. This is causing a complete outage of our services. We have tried restarting the compiler and checking our code, but the errors persist. 

We need urgent assistance to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Please advise on any immediate steps we can take or if there is a known issue with the current version.
