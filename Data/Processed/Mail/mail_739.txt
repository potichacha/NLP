Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing some difficulties scaling our cloud resources through your platform recently. Our application experiences unpredictable slowdowns during peak hours, and we suspect it's linked to resource limitations.

Could you please look into this? We'd appreciate any assistance in optimizing our scaling configuration.

Thanks,
John Doe
