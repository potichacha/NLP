Hi Aetheros Support,

We're evaluating Aetheros for our API development needs and are particularly interested in the Mercury language and its integration with your IAM service.

Could you please provide some information on how Mercury simplifies role-based access control (RBAC) implementation in APIs? Specifically, we'd like to know:

* How are roles and permissions defined and enforced within Mercury code?
* Does Mercury offer any built-in functions or libraries for interacting with the Aetheros IAM service?
* Are there any code examples or documentation that demonstrate how to implement RBAC using Mercury and Aetheros IAM?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
John Doe
