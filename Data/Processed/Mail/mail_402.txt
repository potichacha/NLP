Hello Aetheros Support,

I'm encountering an issue when attempting to deploy new Mercury code to our production environment. The deployment fails consistently, and the logs indicate an error related to insufficient role permissions.

Specifically, the error message is: "Access Denied: Role 'MercuryDeployer' lacks permission 'aetheros:deploy' on resource 'arn:aetheros:mercury:us-west-2:123456789012:code/myapp'". 

We have confirmed that the 'MercuryDeployer' role is correctly assigned to the deployment user in the Aetheros IAM service. Can you please advise on how to troubleshoot this issue?

Thanks,
John Doe
