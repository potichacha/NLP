Dear Isiah,

We have identified the issue. You are currently subscribed to the Basic plan which has limited resources. The deployment requires more resources than your current plan allows. To proceed, you can either:

1. Optimize your application to use fewer resources.
2. Upgrade your plan to one with higher resource limits.

You can find details on our plans and their resources here: [link to pricing page]. If you choose to upgrade, you can do so directly from your Aetheros Cloud dashboard.

Please let us know if you have any further questions. 

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support
