Hello Aetheros Support,

We are facing critical issues with both the API Monitoring service and the Mercury Language. 

Firstly, we are seeing significant discrepancies between the data reported in the API Monitoring dashboard and our internal logs. This is impacting our ability to accurately track API performance and identify potential issues.

Secondly, we're encountering persistent errors when using specific functions within the Mercury Language. These errors are halting our development process and causing significant delays.

We require urgent assistance to resolve these issues as they are severely impacting our operations. Please provide a timely resolution.

Regards,
John Doe
