Hi Aetheros Support,

We are experiencing a critical issue with deploying our Mercury code to production. We are consistently getting a 502 error, and our API is completely down as a result.

This is a high-priority issue as it's impacting our live application and causing significant disruption to our users. We need this resolved as soon as possible.

Here are the details:

* **Mercury version:** 2.3.1
* **Deployment environment:** AWS
* **Error message:** "502 Bad Gateway"

We have checked our server logs and haven't been able to identify the root cause of this error.  Please advise on how to troubleshoot and resolve this issue immediately.

Thanks,
John Doe
