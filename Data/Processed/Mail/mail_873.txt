Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out to Aetheros Support.  We're happy to help with your Mercury error handling question. 

While Mercury doesn't have a direct try-catch equivalent, it utilizes a pattern of result types and error propagation for robust error management. 

You can find a detailed guide on error handling in our official documentation here:

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
