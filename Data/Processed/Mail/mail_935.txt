Dear Isabella,

Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding our API development services, particularly your suggestions for enhancing error handling. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts.

We understand the importance of detailed error messages and standardized error codes in simplifying the debugging process for developers. We're happy to inform you that we're actively working on implementing improvements in this area.

Our team is currently designing a more robust error handling system that will provide more specific error codes and informative messages. This system will aim to offer greater transparency into the underlying issues, enabling developers to identify and resolve problems more efficiently.

We'll keep you updated on the progress of these enhancements. We expect to roll them out in the coming months.

Thank you once again for your suggestion. Your feedback helps us improve our services and better serve our clients.

Best regards,
