Dear John,

We have identified the issue causing the API timeouts. It was due to a surge in traffic that overloaded one of our database servers. We have implemented a fix and can confirm that the API endpoints are now responding normally. 

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. 

Please let us know if you experience any further issues.

Sincerely,
The Aetheros Support Team
