We are experiencing a critical issue with our IAM role permissions in our production environment. The permissions we have configured for a specific role are not being applied correctly, causing disruptions to our application. 

We have verified the role configuration multiple times and it appears to be correct. We have also checked for any conflicting policies, but couldn't find any. This issue started occurring approximately 2 hours ago and we need this resolved ASAP as it is impacting our customers.

Can you please help us investigate and resolve this issue urgently?
