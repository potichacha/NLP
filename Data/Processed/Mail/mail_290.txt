Our production API, built using Aetheros API development services, has been experiencing intermittent downtime for the past hour. This is severely impacting our critical business operations. 

We are seeing a large number of 500 errors and significantly increased latency.  We've also noticed unusual spikes in resource usage within our cloud environment managed by Aetheros.

We require immediate assistance to identify and resolve the root cause of this issue. Please advise on the next steps.
