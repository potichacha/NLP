Hi Aetheros Support,

We've been experiencing intermittent latency spikes with our API that's being monitored by your platform.  It's not happening consistently, but enough to be noticeable. 

Could you take a look and see if there's anything on your end that could be causing this?

Thanks,
John Doe
