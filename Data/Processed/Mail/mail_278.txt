Hi,

Here's the code snippet showing the async calls I'm making:

```mercury
async function fetchData(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  return await response.json();
}

const urls = [
  'https://api.example.com/data1',
  'https://api.example.com/data2',
  'https://api.example.com/data3'
];

async function main() {
  const results = await Promise.all(urls.map(fetchData));
  console.log(results);
}

main();
```

As you can see, I'm using `Promise.all` to handle the concurrent requests. However, the `results` array doesn't always reflect the order of the URLs in the `urls` array.

Any help would be appreciated!

Regards,
John
