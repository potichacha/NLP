Hi Aetheros Support,

We're experiencing a critical issue with our API authentication after updating an IAM role in our production environment yesterday. 

We are using your API development and IAM services. Since the role update, all API requests using this role are failing with a 403 Forbidden error. We have verified that the API keys are correct and haven't expired. 

This is causing a major disruption to our live application. We need this resolved urgently. Please advise on the next steps to troubleshoot and fix this issue as soon as possible.

Sincerely,
Isabella Davis
Lead Backend Engineer
