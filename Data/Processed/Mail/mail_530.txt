We are experiencing an urgent issue where users are unable to access the resources they need through our new API. We recently implemented new roles and permissions using your IAM service, and since then, users have been encountering authorization errors.

We have verified that the API endpoints themselves are functioning correctly. The issue seems to stem from the IAM service not properly applying the new roles and permissions to users during API authentication.

This is a critical issue for us as it is impacting our production environment and preventing users from accessing essential resources. We kindly request your immediate assistance in resolving this matter.

Please let us know what information you need from our end to troubleshoot this issue effectively. We are available for a call if necessary.

Thank you,
