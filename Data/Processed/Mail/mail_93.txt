Dear John,

We have identified the issue. There was a minor bug in our latest system update that caused a conflict with API key revocation and IAM permissions. We have implemented a fix, and access to the API monitoring dashboards should be restored for all users.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this downtime caused. We take these matters very seriously and are taking steps to prevent similar issues in the future.

Please don't hesitate to contact us if you experience any further problems.

Sincerely,
Aetheros Support Team
