Hi Aetheros Support,

I'm writing to suggest an improvement for your IAM service. Currently, managing roles and permissions is straightforward, but it would be incredibly helpful if the IAM service supported role inheritance.

For example, let's say we have a 'developer' role and a 'senior developer' role.  It would be much more efficient if 'senior developer' could inherit all permissions from the 'developer' role, and we could simply add any additional permissions needed.

This would significantly reduce the complexity and time spent on managing roles, especially in larger teams and projects. 

Thank you for considering my suggestion. I believe this feature would greatly benefit many of your users.

Sincerely,
John Doe
