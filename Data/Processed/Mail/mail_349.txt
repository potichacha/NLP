Hi Aetheros Support,

We recently started using your API monitoring service for our new `/v2/products` endpoint. We've noticed some intermittent latency spikes that don't seem to correlate with traffic patterns.

Could you please take a look and see if there's anything on your end that might be causing this?

Thanks,
John Doe
