We are experiencing critical issues with our latest cloud deployment. We are using Aetheros Cloud Management and API Gateway. Deployments are consistently failing with a timeout error related to API Gateway provisioning. 

This is causing a complete outage for our production environment. We need this resolved urgently.

Please advise on next steps.
