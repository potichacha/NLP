Hi Aetheros Support,

Here's the information you requested:

* **Specific times and dates when you experienced the issues:**  We've been experiencing these issues consistently for the past week, particularly during peak hours between 7 PM and 10 PM UTC.
* **Screenshots or error logs (if any):** I've attached the error logs from our API server and cloud management console.
* **Any recent changes made to your application or cloud configuration:** We haven't made any significant changes to our application code recently. However, we did increase the allocated resources for our database server last week to accommodate increased traffic. 

Let me know if you require any further information.

Thanks,
Isiah
