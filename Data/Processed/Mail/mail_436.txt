Hi Aetheros Support Team,

We've been experiencing critical issues with our recent integration of the Aetheros IAM service into our application. 

Specifically, we've noticed unauthorized access attempts and inconsistent permission handling that could lead to a serious security breach.  We need immediate assistance in addressing these vulnerabilities as it poses a significant risk to our data and users.

Please advise on the next steps to resolve this urgently.

Sincerely,
John Doe
