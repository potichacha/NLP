Dear John,

Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion regarding enhancing Mercury's error handling capabilities. We recognize the importance of robust and streamlined error handling in API development.

We appreciate you outlining the specific areas where improvements could be made. The ability to define custom error types, implement structured exception handling, and generate consistent error responses are all valuable features that would enhance the developer experience.

Our team will be discussing your proposal internally to assess its feasibility and potential integration into future versions of the Mercury language.

We value your feedback and will keep you updated on any progress related to this suggestion.

Best regards,
The Aetheros Support Team
