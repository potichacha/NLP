FROM THE APOLLO PRESS, IN BOSTON, BY JOSEPH BELKNAP, No. 8, DOCK-SQUARE. MDCCXCV.
PREFACE.IT is not pretended that any new arguments are advanced in this perform|ance; nor does the author suppose that there is any need of referring to particu|lar books which he has frequently consult|ed, when engaged in studies of this kind.

The controversy has assumed various forms, and has been stimulated by various pas||sions and interests; but it has never been discontinued, or, if silent awhile, it has broken out again from its re|straint.
The opposition to the gospel at this time, appears in a different form from that in the early days of christianity. Then the followers of Christ, were ac|cused before magistrates, or insulted by mobs, or anathematized by synagogues and councils; now, our persons are safe, and ou
