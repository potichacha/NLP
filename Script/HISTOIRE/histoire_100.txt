Upon the just judgement of His Majesties unjust judges


UPON The just judgement of his Majesties Unjust JUDGES.
BUT now they're come to Judgement, Heaven is just,
And tho't be long, before he questions Dust,
They shall not go unpunisht for that thing,
That horrid thing! of murthering their King.
'Twas bad enough, against their King to rise,
But ten times worse, their King to sacrifise;
But worst of all, under a shew of Zeal,
To rob the Church, and spoyl the Common-weal:
And so make God, the Author of their ill,
Pretending 'twas his pleasure, and his will.
Thus, how from sin to sin, the Devil draws
Ambitious spirits, to infringe Gods Laws;
Still prompting them, from what is bad, to worse,
Until they're fitted, for Heavens heavy curse.
Pray Heaven, that their example, and their shame,
May others keep, from thinking of the same.
By George Cartwright, Gent.
