"The memory of the just is blessed."PLYMOUTH, FEB. 24th, 1800.SIR,THE Selectmen of the town of Plymouth, with the warmest sentiments of affection and respect, present you the thanks of said town, for your ingenious and apposite discourse, delivered on the 22d instant, by the unani|mous request of the inhabitants, in legal town-meeting assembled; to commemorate the sublime virtues and pre-eminent worth of the late illustrious GEORGE WASHINGTON; and, in behalf of said town, request a copy thereof for the press.
Per Order,THOMAS WETHRELL.The Rev. Mr. KENDALL.PLYMOUTH, FEB. 25th, 1800.GENTLEMEN,THE very affectionate and obliging manner, in which you, as the representatives of the town, have ex|pressed your approbation of the performance on the 22d inst. has afforded, on this occasion, the most grateful satisfaction. To comply with your request is to be expos|ed, at too early a period, to the criticism of the world. Not to comply, is implicitly refusing to perpetuate, a|mong all classes of the rising generation in this place, the memory of those sublime virtues, and that pre-emi|nent worth, which deserve to be immortal. A copy of the discourse, therefore, is with diffidence of its merit, submitted to your disposal.
With perfect respect and esteem, I am, Gentlemen,your affectionate friend, And very humble servant, JAMES KENDALL.The Gentlemen Selectmen of the town of Plymouth.A DISCOURSE.THIS day, my afflicted friends, gave birth to the greatest of our national blessings. Its annual return has hitherto been welcomed as the jubilee of Americans, and celebrated as the birth-day of their country's glory. A nation once hailed it, as the day of her re|joicing; but, alas! too soon, she is summon|ed to observe it, as the day of mourning. "The joy of her heart has ceased." The heralds of festivity have become the messen|gers of woe. The voice of merriment has yielded to the sigh of affliction. The pensive breeze wafts through the continent the fu|neral knell. The oil of Columbia's joy has turned into mourning, and the garment of her praise to the cypress shade, and the spirit of heaviness. Instead of the birth of the illus|trious Living, we commemorate the virtues, but lament the loss, of the illustrious Dead!
