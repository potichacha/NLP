ESSAYS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE Earl of SHAFTESBURY .


 I. On RIDICULE considered as a Test of Truth .
II .
On the Obligations of Man to Virtue , and the Necessity of religious Principle .
III .
On revealed RELIGION , and CHRISTIANITY .
TO Ralph Allen , Esq. .


 SIR ,


DID this Address aim no farther than at the common End of Dedicators , I should have been proud enough to have declined the Trouble , and You too wise to have approved this public Manner of offering it .


TO praise You , were impertinent ; and to tell others of my Obligations to You , would have the Appearance rather of Vanity than Gratitude .


 THE Truth is ; I make free with Your Name on this Occasion , not so much to protect my Book , as to complete my Argument .


I HAVE ventured to criticize the Works of a very celebrated Writer , who took it into his Head to oppose the solid Wisdom of the Gospel , by the Visions of false Philosophy .
As His , at best , is but the Cause of Wit and Eloquence , all the Support he could give it was only to tell us how PLATO wrote : Mine being that of Truth , and Christianity , I have the Advantage of realizing all I say , in bidding the World take Notice how YOU live .


 IN a Word ; I was willing to bring the Question to a short Issue ; and shew , by a known EXAMPLE , to what an Elevation true Christianity can exalt human Nature .
Till therefore philosophic Taste can produce a parallel Effect , Religion must bear the Palm ; and CHRISTIANITY , like her Parent WISDOM , will be justified of her Children .


I am , SIR , Your most obliged , humble Servant , JOHN BROWN .
