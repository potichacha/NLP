THE GAY LORD QUEX


THE FIRST ACT


The scene represents a manicure establishment in New Bond Street .
It is a front room upon the first floor , with three french-windows affording a view of certain buildings on the east side of the street .
On the left , furthest from the spectator , is a wide , arched opening , apparently leading to another apartment , in which is the door giving entrance to the rooms from the staircase .
Nearer , there is another french-window , opening on to an expanse of `` leads '' and showing the exterior of the wall of the further room above-mentioned .
From the right , above the middle window , runs an ornamental partition , about nine feet in height , with panels of opaque glass .
This partition extends more than half-way across the room , then runs forward for some distance , turns off at a sharp angle , and terminates between the arched opening and the window on the left .
That part of the partition running from right to left is closed on its left side and forms , therefore , a separate room or compartment .
Facing the audience , on the right , is a door admitting to this compartment ; and , on the left , also in the , partition opposite the windows on the right , is an opening with a looped-back porti√®re .
The space between this opening and the further room forms a narrow anteroom , containing articles of furniture visible through the opening .
Mirrors are affixed to the right wall , between the lower and the middle window and between the middle window and the partition , while on the left , between the window and the partition , is another mirror .
A number of business cards are stuck in the frames of the mirrors .
On the right , before each of the two lower windows , turned from the spectator , is a capacious arm-chair , made in cane open-work .
