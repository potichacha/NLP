Magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo.
Jam redit & Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna:
Jam nova progenies, coelo dimittitur alto.
Huic ego nec metas rerum, nec tempora pono: Imperium sine fine dedi.

Equality, the life and soul of commonwealth, cuts off all pretensions to preferment, but those which arise from extra|ordinary merit: Whereas in royal governments, he that can best
