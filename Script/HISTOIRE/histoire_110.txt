MARIUS THE EPICUREAN , VOLUME ONE


PART THE FIRST


CHAPTER I : `` THE RELIGION OF NUMA ''


[ 3 ] As , in the triumph of Christianity , the old religion lingered latest in the country , and died out at last as but paganism - the religion of the villagers , before the advance of the Christian Church ; so , in an earlier century , it was in places remote from town-life that the older and purer forms of paganism itself had survived the longest .
While , in Rome , new religions had arisen with bewildering complexity around the dying old one , the earlier and simpler patriarchal religion , `` the religion of Numa , '' as people loved to fancy , lingered on with little change amid the pastoral life , out of the habits and sentiment of which so much of it had grown .
Glimpses of such a survival we may catch below the merely artificial attitudes of Latin pastoral poetry ; in Tibullus especially , who has preserved for us many poetic details of old Roman religious usage .

Numen Inest !
- it was in natural harmony with the temper of a quiet people amid the spectacle of rural life , like that simpler faith between man and man , which Tibullus expressly connects with the period when , with an inexpensive worship , the old wooden gods had been still pressed for room in their homely little shrines .


And about the time when the dying Antoninus Pius ordered his golden image of Fortune to be carried into the chamber of his successor ( now about to test the truth of the old Platonic contention , that the world would at last find itself [ 5 ] happy , could it detach some reluctant philosophic student from the more desirable life of celestial contemplation , and compel him to rule it ) , there was a boy living in an old country-ho
