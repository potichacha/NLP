THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY, TO THE MEN OF KENT.GENTLEMEN,I TAKE the Liberty of recom|mending to your Patronage the following Discourse, the Design of which is to record the Military Fame and Character of the late illustrious General WOLFE.
I WILLINGLY undertook the Task, unbiassed and unasked; pre|suming, tho' my Abilities were far unequal to it, (for an ACHILLES should be described by an HOMER, and an ALEXANDER painted by an APELLES) that it would meet with a favourable Reception, both from the Novelty of the Composition, rarely attempted among us, and the Ex|cèllence of the Object it celebrates.
AN Address to none but you, Gentlemen, seemed proper on this
Occasion; because, as it is your Country that gave Birth to, and nursed the Hero, it was but just you should, on that Account, share in the Elogiums, which are due to his Merit; and even pride your|selves, that, with the general Ap|plause of the Nation, you can again add to your List of Kentish Worthies, in Church and State, in the Army and Navy, the Name of a Man of Kent, who is the Glory of the present Age, and will be the Admiration of the future.
Go on, Gentlemen, and prosper. May you never want a Race of Heroes; and may every Man a|mong you, in the Support and De|fence of his Country, prove himself a TRUE MAN OF KENT, which is the hearty Wish of,
GENTLEMEN, Your most humble, and respectful Servant,

These are the Words of David, acknowledging, in the Jubilation of a Heart full of Gratitude, the Power of God; when He, the Lord, his Strength and Buckler, the Horn of his Salvation, and high Tower, delivered him from the Hand of all his Enemies, and from the Hand of Saul.
THE same great and mighty God, gloriousin Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders, has lately manifested his Power and stretched-out Arm, in Defence of this Nation; his Munificence has showered down upon us all the Blessings of Peace, whilst his Justice makes other Nations feel all the Calamities of War; he has crowned our Arms with signal Successes both by Sea and Land; the
Haughtiness of our inveterate Foes h
