A Minister's solemn farewel to his people.IId CORINTHIANS, 13 Chap. 11 Verse.FINALLY, BRETHREN, FAREWEL: BE PERFECT; BE OF GOOD COMFORT; BE OF ONE MIND; LIVE IN PEACE; AND THE GOD OF LOVE AND PEACE SHALL BE WITH YOU.

Finally, Brethren, farewel: Be per|fect; be of good comfort; be of one mind; live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.
It shall be the business of this discourse to ex|plain the meaning of the several branches of this valedictory exhortation, and to apply the subject to the present occasion.
The first clause in the text, Brethren farewel, requires very little illustration. It is a common expression of kindness, or mode of civility, by which acquaintance and friends take their leave of each other; and it imports a hearty desire of the welfare of those to whom it is addressed. The

very formation of the word holds up this idea. It is compounded of fare and well; and there|fore the use of it, on occasion of parting with our friends, evidently expresses a wish, that they may fare well in our absence, or enjoy the sweets of health and prosperity. When it is used by chris|tian friends, it implies a
