Head Quarters, Newburgh, June 18, 1783.SIR,_THE great object, for which I had the honor to hold an appointment in the service of my country, being ac|complished, I am now preparing to resign it into the hands of Congress, and return to that do|mestic retirement, which, it is

well known, I left with the great|est reluctance; a retirement for which I have never ceased to sigh through a long and painful absence, in which (remote from the noise and trouble of the world) I meditate to pass the remainder of life, in a state of undisturbed repose; but, before I carry this resolution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me to make this my last official communica|tion, to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been pleased to produce in our favour, to offer my senti|ments

The citizens of America, placed in the most enviable condition, as the sole Lords and Proprie|tors of a vast tract of continent, comprehending all the various soils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the ne|cessaries and conveniencies of life, are now, by the late satis|factory
