LETTERS Written TO and FOR PARTICULAR FRIENDS , On the most IMPORTANT OCCASIONS .
Directing not only the Requisite STYLE and FORMS To be Observed in WRITING Familiar Letters ; But How to THINK and ACT Justly and Prudently , IN THE COMMON CONCERNS OF HUMAN LIFE .


CONTAINING One Hundred and Seventy-three LETTERS , None of which were ever before Published .


LONDON : Printed for C. RIVINGTON , in St. Paul 's Church-yard ; J. OSBORN , in Pater-noster Row ; and J. LEAKE , at Bath , M.DCC.XLI .
PREFACE .



THE following Letters are publish'd at the Solicitation of particular Friends , who are of Opinion , that they will answer several good Ends , as they may not only direct the Forms requisite to be observed on the most important Occasions ; but , what is more to the Purpose , by the Rules and Instructions contained in them , contribute to mend the Heart , and improve the Understanding .


NATURE , PROPRIETY of CHARACTER , PLAIN SENSE , and GENERAL USE , have been the chief Objects of the Author 's Attention in the penning of these Letters ; and as he every-where aimed to write to the Judgment , rather than to the Imagination , he would chuse , that they should generally be found more useful  than diverting : Tho ' , where the Subjects require Strokes of Humour , and innocent Raillery , it will be seen , perhaps , that the Method he has taken , was the Effect of Choice , and not merely of Necessity .


The Writer is no Friend to long Prefaces ; but it may be necessary , however , to say , what he has aimed at in this Performance ; and to leave his Merit in the Execution of it , to proper Judges .


He has endeavour'd then , in general , throughout the great Variety of his Subjects , to inculcate the Principles of Virtue and Benevolence ; to describe properly , and recommend strongly , the SOCIAL and RELATIVE DUTIES ; and to place them in such practical Lights , that the Letters may serve for Rules to THINK and ACT by , as well as Forms to WRITE after .


Particularly , he has endeavoured to point out the Duty of a Servant , not a Slave ; the Duty of a Master , not a Tyrant ; that of the Parent , not as a Person morose and sour , and hard to be pleased ; but mild , indulgent , kind , and such an one as would rather govern by Persuasion than Force .


 He has endeavour'd to direct the young Man in the Choice of his Friends and Companions ; to excite him to Diligence ; to discourage Extravagance , Sottish
