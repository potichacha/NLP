{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'This configuration is for an alert that monitors CPU usage on a system. Here\'s how it works: The alert uses a "DB LOOKUP" to retrieve data from a database. Specifically, it looks at the "system.cpu" chart and calculates the average of the sum of several CPU dimensions (user, system, softirq, irq, and guest) over the past 10 minutes (starting from 10 minutes ago and up to now), using the "unaligned" option. The alert has two "SEVERITY CONDITIONS" that determine when to trigger a warning or critical alert. These conditions use a formula that compares the current CPU usage to certain threshold values, which are different depending on the status of the alert (either WARNING or CRITICAL). The formula is: In summary, this alert is monitoring CPU usage on a system and will trigger a warning or critical alert if the usage exceeds certain threshold values, which are calculated based on the current status of the alert. The alert is checked every 60 seconds.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Yes, you can adapt this alert to use the median instead of the average of the CPU usage data. Here\'s how you can modify the configuration: Change the aggregation method from "average" to "median" in the "DB LOOKUP" configuration. You can do this by changing the word "average" to "median" in the configuration line that specifies the aggregation method: Adjust the threshold values in the "SEVERITY CONDITIONS" section based on the median value of the CPU usage data. Since the median is a different type of statistic than the average, you may need to adjust the threshold values to account for the difference. For example, if you previously used a threshold of 75% for the WARNING level when using the average, you may need to adjust it to a lower value when using the median, depending on the distribution of the CPU usage data. Similarly, if you previously used a threshold of 85% for the CRITICAL level when using the average, you may need to adjust it to a lower or higher value when using the median, depending on the distribution of the CPU usage data. Once you\'ve made these modifications, you can save the updated configuration and run the alert to monitor CPU usage based on the median value.'}
