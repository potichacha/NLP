{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To create a Python script that reads a 16-bit mono WAV file, scales down the samples to 12-bit, converts them to unsigned, and writes them to a binary file, you can use the  wave  module to read WAV files and  struct  module to handle binary data. Here's a script to accomplish this task: Save this code to a file named  wav_to_12bit_bin.py . To use the script, run it in a terminal with the input WAV file and output binary file as arguments, like this: Make sure to replace  input.wav  and  output.bin  with the paths to your actual files."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Using  numpy  can indeed speed up the process. Here's the updated script using  numpy : Save this code to a file named  wav_to_12bit_bin_np.py . To use the script, run it in a terminal with the input WAV file and output binary file as arguments, like this: Make sure to replace  input.wav  and  output.bin  with the paths to your actual files."}
