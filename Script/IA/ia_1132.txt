{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Mermaid.js does not support creating charts for interpolation functions directly. However, you can use a flowchart to represent the high-level process of an interpolation function. Here's a simple flowchart illustrating the process using a linear interpolation function as an example: This flowchart represents a linear interpolation function with input values x0, y0, x1, y1, and x. It calculates the parameter t, and then computes the interpolated y value using the calculated t. Finally, it outputs the interpolated y value. Remember to include the Mermaid.js library on your HTML page to render the chart correctly. For more information, visit the Mermaid.js documentation:"}

The issue was with the use of spaces in the subgraph name, which I've now replaced with an underscore."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "I apologize for my previous response. I've made another mistake in the Mermaid.js code. To resolve the issue, we need to avoid using curly braces  {}  and use a regular text representation for formulas. Here is the corrected version of the flowchart: In this version, I've replaced the curly braces  {}  with parentheses  ()  for the formulas inside the nodes. This should resolve the parse error."}
