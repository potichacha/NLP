{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Sure! Here\'s a formula that you can use to search for a specific value in a column, row, or date and return a summary: Here\'s what each of the parameters does: range : This is the range of cells that you want to search. It can be a single column, a single row, or a range of cells. criteria : This is the value that you want to search for in the range. It can be a specific text string, a number, or a date. [sum_range] : This is the range of cells that you want to sum. It should be the same size as the range parameter. If you omit this parameter, the formula will sum all cells in the range. For example, let\'s say that you have a table with the following data: To search for the sales on a specific date and return the sum, you could use the following formula: This formula would search the range A2:A5 for the value "1/2/2022", and then return the sum of the cells in the range B2:B5 that correspond to the matching cells in A2:A5. In this case, the formula would return 200. You can also use wildcards in the criteria parameter to search for a partial match. For example, the following formula would return the sum of all sales in January: I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you\'d like more information.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To search for two criteria using the SUMIF function, you can use the SUMIFS function, which allows you to specify multiple criteria to search for in different ranges. Here\'s the syntax for the SUMIFS function: sum_range : This is the range of cells that you want to sum. range1 : This is the first range of cells that you want to search. criteria1 : This is the value that you want to search for in the first range. [range2] : This is the second range of cells that you want to search. [criteria2] : This is the value that you want to search for in the second range. You can specify as many range/criteria pairs as you like. The function will return the sum of all cells in the sum range that match all of the specified criteria. For example, let\'s say that you have a table with the following data: To search for the sales of apples on a specific date and return the sum, you could use the following formula: This formula would search the range A2:A6 for the value "1/2/2022", and the range B2:B6 for the value "Apples". It would then return the sum of the cells in the range C2:C6 that correspond to the matching cells in A2:A6 and B2:B6. In this case, the formula would return 200. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you\'d like more information.'}
