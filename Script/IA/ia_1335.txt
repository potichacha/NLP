{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "The  double  variable  score  is initialized with a value of -1 because it needs to have some initial value before the  while  loop starts. The loop will repeatedly prompt the user to enter a grade until the grade entered is valid, and since the valid grade range is between 0 and 100, -1 is not a valid grade. By initializing the  score  variable to -1, the loop is guaranteed to run at least once. It is possible to set  score  to any other value, as long as it is not within the valid grade range of 0 to 100. For example, it could be set to -999 or any other value outside the valid range. In the context of the rest of the program, the initial value assigned to  score  is not important, as long as it is not within the valid grade range. Once the user enters a valid grade, the value of  score  will be updated with the user's input, and the loop will exit."}
