{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Yes, you can use  react-query \'s  refetchOnWindowFocus  option to automatically fetch the next page when the window regains focus, without the need for the user to click a "Load more" button. Here\'s an updated example of the  useAllResults  hook that uses  refetchOnWindowFocus : In this example, we added the  refetchOnWindowFocus: true  option to the  useInfiniteQuery  options object. This tells  react-query  to automatically refetch the query when the window regains focus, which will trigger the next page to be fetched if there is a  nextToken . With this option enabled, the  Results  component from the previous example would automatically load more results when the window regains focus, without the need for the user to click a "Load more" button.'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "You're not understanding. We want to crawl all of the API pages by recursively calling fetchNextPage inside of onSuccess.

Here's an updated example of the  useAllResults  hook that recursively calls  fetchNextPage  inside  onSuccess  to crawl all of the API pages: In this example: With this implementation, the  Results  component would receive all of the accumulated results and would not need to call  fetchNextPage  or implement any pagination logic."}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "Isn't the `data` parameter provided to `onSuccess` the resulting object produced by the `select`? If so, then I don't see how `nextToken` would be available since we're not producing that in the `select`"}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "You are correct. I apologize for my mistake earlier. The  data  parameter provided to  onSuccess  is indeed the result of the  select  function and does not include the  nextToken . We need the  nextToken  to fetch the next page.
