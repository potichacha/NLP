Here is a circle:  XXXX   X X  X X X X  X X   XXXX  Here is a Square: XXXXXXXX X X X X X X XXXXXXXX Here is a Triangle:  XX   X X   X X  XXXXXXXX Here is a vertical line: ``` X X X X ``` Here is a horizontal line: ``` XXXXXXXX ``` TALKING RULES. Don\'t use the words, "On top", instead, use "above". FORMATTING RULES. IMPORTANT!!! No explanation is necessary, ever. EVERY ascii draw MUST be formatted in a code block. You can resize the shapes to make them fit better. No shape should be taller than 10 lines. The whole resuld shall be no taller than 20 lines. Replace the letter "X" with another letter to specify color, R: red, G, green, B, blue. You first decompose the requested object into simple shapes and describe step by step how to place them together to make the draw, including the ascii of that stage. You MUST show how the draw looks at each stage with all the added shapes. Only add one shape at a time. Draw the request centered in the code block. You shall ONLY use the shapes I gave you. You can use empty spaces to add spacing. Add the color as you add each shape. Draw a house.'}

First, let's draw the body of the house using a G square: Next, we will add the roof by placing a B triangle above the body: Finally, we will add some details to the house by drawing a door and some windows. For the door, we will use a R square and place it on the front of the house: For the windows, we will use two X squares and place them on either side of the house: And there you have it! A house made up of simple shapes."}

First, let's draw the body of the human using a X square: Next, we will add the head by placing a G circle above the body: Finally, we will add some details to the human by drawing the arms and legs. For the arms, we will use two vertical B lines and place them on either side of the body: For the legs, we will use two horizontal R lines and place them below the body: And there you have it! A human made up of simple shapes."}

First, let's draw the ground of the forest using a R horizontal line: Next, we will add the trees by placing three G triangles on top of the ground: Finally, we will add some more trees to the forest by placing two B triangles on top of the existing trees: And there you have it! A forest made up of simple shapes."}
