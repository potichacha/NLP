{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Based on the Terraform configuration provided, here are some security recommendations according to AWS best practices: Use a custom Security Group instead of the "default" security group to better control the inbound and outbound traffic rules. Minimize open ports in the Security Group configuration. Only allow traffic to required ports and restrict access to specific IP addresses or ranges. Enable encryption for the root EBS volume by setting the  encrypted  attribute to  true  in the  root_block_device  block. Enable monitoring by setting the  monitoring  attribute to  true . This will enable Amazon CloudWatch monitoring for the instance, helping you track and respond to security-related events. Enable IMDSv2 (Instance Metadata Service Version 2) for the instance by setting  http_tokens  to "required" in the  metadata_options  block. This helps to protect instance metadata from potential SSRF attacks. Restrict SSH access to the instance by creating a dedicated key pair for the instance and managing it securely. Regularly patch the underlying operating system and software of the inst
