{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To create a Go-ACME Lego challenge solver for Google Domains, you can follow the steps below: Install Go-ACME Lego: Follow the instructions on the official Go-ACME Lego repository to install the package on your system. Create a new Go package: Create a new package in your Go workspace where you\'ll write the code for the challenge solver. You can name the package anything you like, for example, "google_domains_solver". Implement the ChallengeSolver interface: In your new package, create a new file named "google_domains_challenge_solver.go" and implement the ChallengeSolver interface defined in the Go-ACME Lego package. This interface requires you to implement two methods,  Present  and  CleanUp . Implement the Present method: In the  Present  method, you\'ll need to make an API call to the Google Domains API to create a new DNS record for the domain and set its value to the provided challenge token. You can use the  google-api-go-client  package to make the API call. The API endpoint for creating a new DNS record is  /dns/v1/projects/<project>/managedZones/<managed_zone>/changes . You\'ll need to replace  <project>  and  <managed_zone>  with the appropriate values for your Google Domains account. Once the API call is successful, the DNS record will propagate and the ACME server will be able to verify the challenge. Implement the CleanUp method: In the  CleanUp  method, you\'ll need to make an API call to the Google Domains API to delete the DNS record that you created in the  Present  method. The API endpoint for deleting a DNS record is  /dns/v1/projects/<project>/managedZones/<managed_zone>/changes/<change_id> . You\'ll need to replace  <project> ,  <managed_zone> , and  <change_id>  with the appropriate values for your Google Domains account. Once the API call is successful, the DNS record will be deleted. Integrate with credentials.yaml: To integrate with the  credentials.yaml  file, you can use the  gopkg.in/yaml.v3  package to read the file and parse the YAML data. You can then use the parsed data to loop through each
