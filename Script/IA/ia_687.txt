Rest your hands on your lap, palms facing up or down, whatever feels more comfortable to you. Take a few deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. As you exhale, feel any tension and stress leaving your body. Focus your attention on the base of your spine, where the root chakra is located. Visualize a bright red light spinning clockwise in this area, getting brighter and larger with each inhale, and calming down with each exhale. As you continue to breathe and focus on the red light, repeat the following affirmations to yourself silently or out loud: Allow yourself to sit with the energy of the root chakra for a few more minutes, focusing on the sensation of stability and groundedness it provides you. When you're ready to end the meditation, slowly bring your awareness back to the present moment. Take a deep breath in and exhale fully, feeling grounded and present. I hope this meditation helps you connect with your root chakra and provides you with a sense of stability and security. Remember to practice this meditation regularly to strengthen your root chakra and your overall sense of groundedness."}
