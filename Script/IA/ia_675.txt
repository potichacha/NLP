{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'As an AI language model, I cannot directly create the website for you. However, I can provide you with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets you need to create a website similar to the Supreme website with a minimalist table of contents. Here\'s the code: This code creates a simple webpage with a table of contents in the style of the Supreme website. The table of contents includes two items, "Are You Smarter Than an LLM?" and "Learn More", which will be displayed with minimalist font. You can customize the styling further by modifying the  styles.css  file to suit your preferences. Save the HTML code in a file named "index.html" and the CSS code in a file named "styles.css" in the same directory. Open the "index.html" file in a web browser to view the webpage.'}

If you haven't done this yet, follow the instructions in the Astro documentation:  Once you have an Astro project set up, you can create the Astro components for the website.

Make sure to create the  src/components/Header.astro  and  src/components/TableOfContents.astro  files and save the code above in the respective files. Then, copy the CSS code to the  src/styles.css  file. To preview your Astro project, run  npm run dev  or  yarn dev  in your terminal, and open  http://localhost:3000  in your browser."}
