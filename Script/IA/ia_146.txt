{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Sony cameras that use the same lens mount as the Sony A7S III and are therefore compatible with the lenses you already have include: These are just a few examples and there may be other Sony cameras that are compatible with your lenses as well. However, it is important to note that not all features may be available on these other cameras and that some lenses may not perform as well on lower-end models due to differences in sensor size and performance.'}
