As a leader in global development, the World Bank's Finance, Competitiveness & Innovation Global Practice Group (FCI) acknowledges the crucial role it plays in addressing this issue. Given the declining availability of grant funding for rural water systems, in this memo we will evaluate the viability of using revenue-backed loans to finance low-cost water systems and presents recommendations to FCI on whether to support this initiative. The Issue The Agua Clara program, founded in 2005 by Dr. Monroe Weber-Shirk and other engineering faculty and students at Cornell University, designs sustainable water treatment plants using open-source technology. These plants have proven particularly well-suited to rural communities in developing countries, as they can be built using locally available materials by local labor and operated by someone with a 6th-grade education, all without requiring electricity to run. Over the past 18 years, Agua Clara has built 19 plants in India and Central America that serve over 70,000 people, with funding provided primarily through grant money from donor governments and NGOs. However, with grant funding becoming increasingly scarce, the program is exploring the use of revenue-backed loans as an alternative funding option for covering part or all of the costs. Although the revenue-backed loan structure presents an alternative to grant funding, the proposed loan structure for financing low-cost rural water systems through the Agua Clara program may have limitations and risks. As shown in the hypothetical case study in Honduras (Table 1), this loan structure requires significant upfront costs that small rural communities may struggle to secure without significant external support. The substantial costs of initial construction, capitalized interest, and financing may be significant barriers to entry for community water boards in rural areas. Moreover, while the rate covenant in the provided sample loan agreement aims to ensure that the borrower can fulfill their debt service obligations, concerns may arise about the affordability of water tariffs for low-income households. In the case study, the monthly household bill is $28.70, which may be unaffor
