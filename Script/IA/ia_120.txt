{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'I apologize for the mistake, the issue is that after reading the data from the first channel the pointer of the buffer is already at the end, so when trying to read the data from the second channel, there is no data to read. The fix for this issue is to move the pointer back to the start of the buffer before reading the data from the second channel. Here is the corrected code: This should plot the data from both channels. Please let me know if you have any other questions.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Here is the updated code that plots the data from both channels on separate y-axes: This code creates a  figure  object and two  axes  objects. The first axes,  ax1 , is used to plot the data from channel 1 and the second axes,  ax2 , is used to plot the data from channel 2. The  twinx()  method is used to create the second y-axis that shares the same x-axis as the first y-axis. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.'}
