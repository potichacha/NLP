{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "UTI stands for Urinary Tract Infection, which is a common infection that occurs in the urinary system, including the bladder, kidneys, ureters, and urethra. UTIs can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi and can affect people of all ages and genders. The symptoms of UTI may include a strong, persistent urge to urinate, a burning sensation while urinating, passing frequent, small amounts of urine, cloudy or strong-smelling urine, and discomfort in the lower abdomen or back. UTIs are typically treated with antibiotics, which can help to clear the infection and alleviate symptoms. It's important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have a UTI, as untreated infections can lead to more serious complications, such as kidney damage or sepsis."}
