{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Ruska Roma, also known as Finnish Roma or Kalesi Roma, refers to a subgroup of the Romani people who live primarily in Finland and Sweden. They have their own unique dialect of the Romani language and are known for their distinctive cultural practices, such as their traditional music and dance. The Ruska Roma are believed to have originated from the Romani people who migrated to Finland from Russia in the 16th century. Over time, they developed their own cultural traditions and have maintained a strong sense of identity as a distinct subgroup of the Romani people. Like many Roma communities around the world, the Ruska Roma have faced discrimination and marginalization throughout history. However, in recent years, efforts have been made to recognize and support their cultural heritage, and to promote greater understanding and acceptance of their community.'}
