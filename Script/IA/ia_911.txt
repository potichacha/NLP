{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "I accidentally changed some files in my Nextcloud instance. (I removed location data from some photos). I need to change them back to an earlier version. I have the list of the files. It's about 100 files. I don't want to use the UI to change photo by photo, as that would take far too long and would be error-prone? Is there some other way? It's okay to use the API also and run some program."}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Yes, you can use the Nextcloud API to revert the files to an earlier version. To do this, you can write a simple script using a programming language like Python. The script will utilize the Nextcloud WebDAV API to revert the files to their previous versions. Here's a Python script using the  requests  library that demonstrates how to revert multiple files to an earlier version using the Nextcloud API:"}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Sure, continuing from where we left off: This part of the script continues from the previous sections and completes the  revertFile  function. It then defines a  revertAllFiles  function that iterates through the  filesToRevert  list and calls the  revertFile  function for each file. Finally, it calls the  revertAllFiles  function to start the process.'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Look, I found this information about how to revert files in nextcloud: Versions\uf0c1 Nextcloud makes the versions of files available via the webdav endpoint. Listing the versions of a file\uf0c1 To obtain all the version of a file a normal PROPFIND has to be send to https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/versions/USER/versions/FILEID. This will list the versions for this file. The name is the timestamp of the version. Restoring a version\uf0c1 To restore a version all that needs to be done is to move a version the special restore folder at https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/versions/USER/restore Are you sure your code is already correct?'}
