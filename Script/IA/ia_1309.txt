{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "As an AI language model, I can't build the chrome extension for you, but I can guide you through the process of building it yourself. To build the chrome extension, you will need to have knowledge of web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will also need to familiarize yourself with the chrome extension development process. Here's an outline of how you could build the chrome extension: First, create a manifest.json file. This file is used to define the extension's properties, such as its name, version, and permissions. Next, create a popup.html file. This will be the interface that the user sees when they click on the extension icon. You can use HTML and CSS to create the interface. Use JavaScript to create the functionality of the extension. You will need to write code that connects to the HBO Max streaming service and retrieves the video stream URL. You can use the HBO Max API to achieve this. Once you have retrieved the video stream URL, you will need to generate a link that the user can share with their friends. You can use a URL shortening service like bit.ly to create a short URL. Finally, you will need to add functionality that allows the user to copy the link and share it with their friends. You can use the Clipboard API to achieve this. Once you have completed these steps, you can package the extension and publish it to the Chrome Web Store. Note that this is a simplified outline of the process, and there may be additional steps or challenges that you encounter along the way. However, with some web development knowledge and persistence, you should be able to build the chrome extension you desire."}
