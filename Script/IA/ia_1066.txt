"Hi Ben, Nice to meet you! There is no specific reading that you need to do before coming, however ongoing the RACGP website has good resources and Australian Family Physician articles can be good to read for topics as they arise. Just business casual is perfect. \u200bIf you can come in about 8:45 am next week that would be great as I can give you a quick orientation to the clinic, but if not that\'s fine we can do it at lunch time. I usually have appointments booked 9am-5pm. You can use this email if you need to contact me at any stage or the clinic\'s number is 03 9687 2271 Looking forward to meeting you in person,"'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Dear [Supervisor's Name], Thank you so much for your warm reply. I'm glad to hear that there isn't any specific reading that I need to do before coming, but I will definitely check out the resources on the RACGP website and read up on Australian Family Physician articles as topics arise. Thank you for letting me know that business casual attire is appropriate. I will make sure to dress accordingly. I appreciate your offer to give me a quick orientation to the clinic, and I would be more than happy to come in at 8:45 am next week. I believe it will be beneficial for me to learn about the clinic's procedures and policies before getting started. However, if that is not possible, lunchtime is also fine for me. I understand that your schedule is quite busy with appointments booked from 9am-5pm. Please let me know if there are any specific times that would work best for you to discuss any questions or concerns I may have during my time with you. Thank you for providing me with your email and the clinic's number. I will definitely use them if I need to get in touch with you. I'm really excited to meet you in person and learn from you. Thank you for this opportunity. Warm Regards, [Your Name]"}
