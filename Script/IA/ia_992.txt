{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Gray level techniques are used in image processing to manipulate the intensity levels of gray-scale images. These techniques can be used to enhance images, extract features, or segment images. Here are some of the common gray level techniques with diagrams: Original Image: Negated Image: Original Image: Thresholded Image: Original Image: Contrast Stretched Image: Original Image: Equalized Image: These are just a few examples of the many gray level techniques used in image processing. Each technique has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of technique will depend on the specific application and desired outcome.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Linear filters are used in image processing to perform operations on an image, such as blurring or sharpening, by applying a mathematical function to each pixel in the image. Here are some of the common linear filters: These are just a few examples of the many linear filters used in image processing.

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Order statistic filters are non-linear filters used in image processing to remove noise and preserve image details. These filters replace each pixel value in an image with a value determined by the pixel values in a local neighborhood. Here are some common order statistic filters: Median Filter: A median filter is a non-linear filter that replaces each pixel in an image with the median value of its neighboring pixels. The median filter is effective in reducing noise in an image while preserving edges and details, and it is particularly useful for removing salt and pepper noise. Maximum and Minimum Filters: A maximum filter replaces each pixel in an image with the maximum value of its neighboring pixels in a specified window size. A minimum filter replaces each pixel in an image with the minimum value of its neighboring pixels in a specified window size. These filters are useful in removing small bright or dark spots in an image. Midpoint Filter: A midpoint filter replaces each pixel in an image with the average of the maximum and minimum values in its neighboring pixels in a specified window size. This filter is useful in removing salt and pepper noise while preserving the overall brightness of an image. Alpha-Trimmed Mean Filter: An alpha-trimmed mean filter replaces each pixel in an image with the mean of the neighboring pixels after removing the alpha lowest and alpha highest values in a specified window size. This filter is effective in removing impulse noise, such as salt and pepper noise, and it can be adjusted to balance between noise reduction and ed
