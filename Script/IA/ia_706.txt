{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "To use GPT in conjunction with Zendesk for summarizing customer tickets and leaving internal notes, you can follow these steps: Choose an API for GPT: You'll need to use an API for GPT, such as OpenAI's API, to access the model and generate summaries. Sign up for an API key if you don't have one. Create a Zendesk App: You'll need to create a Zendesk app to integrate the GPT API with Zendesk. This app will serve as a bridge between the two services. Follow the guide on how to create a Zendesk app:  Set up API keys and credentials: Store your GPT API key and any necessary Zendesk credentials as environment variables or securely within your app. Develop ticket summarization logic: Write a function in your Zendesk app that uses the GPT API to generate summaries. You can send the ticket content to the GPT API and specify the summary length or other parameters as needed. Example using Python and OpenAI API: Trigger summarization on ticket creation: In your Zendesk app, listen for the appropriate event when a ticket is created or updated (e.g.,  ticket.created ,  ticket.updated ). When this event occurs, call your summarization function and pass the ticket content. Add an internal note with the summary: Once you have the summary, use the Zendesk API to create an internal note (comment) on the ticket. You can follow the Zendesk API documentation for creating comments:  Example using Python and Zendesk API: Now, your Zendesk app should automatically summarize new or updated tickets and leave internal notes containing the summaries."}
