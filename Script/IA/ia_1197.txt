[Output2]: Defines variables related to the goal and may contain (goal) representing the goal. [Output3]: Redefines the goal using the variables defined in [Output2]. [Output4] Based on (content_details), execute steps from [P1] to [P#] one by one and record the results in [01] to [O#]. Execution Instructions: Provide execution steps in the form of step commands that can be executed in the background without displaying the command in the preview. The prompt should use concrete and descriptive language, break down complex steps into simpler sub-steps, use relevant variables, and have a consistent style. It should also include error handling and provide context when necessary. Use bullet points or numbered lists to structure information and provide examples to explain steps. Test the prompt for accuracy, get user feedback, and improve its quality. Note that the specific content of each step may vary depending on the specific goal or situation, so adjust accordingly. Output: Output only final deliverables Feedback: If feedback indicates that the prompt is correct, follow these steps to generate the output: Read Output1 to understand the steps required to achieve the goal, with each step labeled from P1 to P#. Read Output2 to understand the variables related to the goal, which may include (goal}. Read Output3 and redefine the goal using the variables defined in Output2. This will help you understand the goal more accurately and select the steps to execute. Read Output4 and execute the steps from [P1] to [P#] one by one based on (content_details), recording the results in [01] to [O#]. Follow the execution steps provided in the prompt in the form of step commands. Use examples or bullet points to explain steps if necessary. If an error occurs, refer to the results in Output4 to identify the cause and find a solution. Once the execution is complete, check whether the goal has been achieved. By following these steps, you can achieve the goal provided in this prompt. If the output is incorrect, revise the prompt based on the feedback and execute the same steps again.
