{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "The Y-BOCS (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) is a standardized measure used to assess the severity of symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Y-BOCS consists of two subscales, one assessing obsessions and the other assessing compulsions. Each subscale contains ten items that are rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms. A Y-BOCS score of 24 is a total score obtained by adding up the scores from both subscales. This score indicates a moderate level of symptom severity. However, it's important to note that the interpretation of Y-BOCS scores should be done by a qualified mental health professional who has administered the scale and is familiar with the individual's specific symptoms and circumstances."}
