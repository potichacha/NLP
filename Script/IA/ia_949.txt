{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'I have a table called orders_order which is joined to a table called orders_checkout which contains an email column that represents the identity of a shopper. I would like to iterate through the orders table and create a list that shows the percentage of new shoppers vs return shoppers where each row in the list represents a day. If a shopper has created an order in the past that is considered a return shopper but if they have not that is considered a new shopper. How could I do this in SQL within a Postgres database?'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "You can use a combination of SQL aggregate functions and subqueries to generate a list that shows the percentage of new and returning shoppers for each day. Here's an example query that should work for your scenario: Here's what the query is doing step-by-step: Note that the query assumes that the created_at column in the orders_order table is a timestamp that contains the date and time of the order. If it only contains the date, you can remove the date_trunc('day', ...) calls and the query should still work."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'I apologize for the confusion. The issue is that when calculating the new shopper percentage, we need to exclude returning shoppers from the total shopper count. Here is the updated query that should fix the issue: I added a NULLIF function to avoid divide-by-zero errors, and I modified the new_shopper_percentage calculation to exclude returning shoppers from the total shopper count. Thank you for your patience and for bringing this to my attention.'}
