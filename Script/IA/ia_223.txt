{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Sure, let's begin! As an ENT doctor, I would start by asking you some questions to better understand the patient's symptoms and medical history. So, tell me more about the patient's ear pain. When did it start? Is it constant or does it come and go? Does it affect one ear or both? Is the pain sharp, dull, or throbbing? And is there any associated hearing loss, dizziness, or ringing in the ears? Also, has the patient had any recent infections or illnesses? Do they have a history of ear problems or allergies? Are they taking any medications or have they had any recent changes in their lifestyle? The more information we can gather, the better we can diagnose the cause of their ear pain."}

The symptoms are often the worse first thing in the morning and sometimes flares up towards the evening as well. He describes that if he hears a sound, he hears the sound like his eardrum is a cheap set of speakers being put to max volume and the peaks in the sound breaks apart. He also describes hearing sound like someone is beating on his ear drum. Long car rides are difficult for him because the drone of wind, road, and engine noise is loud and it wears him down. He currently has to wear noise-canceling headphones when going on long drives. He reports his energy is great if he drives with those headphones on. One morning he described the sound of beating an egg with the fork hitting the bowl as unbearable.  He does not have hearing loss, in fact, we did a hearing test at the hospital and he has perfect hearing. No dizziness was reported and sometimes has ringing in his ears but not often.  His symptoms do get worse when he has a sinus infection. He also has allergies each spring and fall, he often has sneezing fits that are difficult to handle.  He was diagnosed with a severely deviated septum and had surgery to correct it. He said having his deviated septum helped reduce the severity of his symptoms but did not remove it.  The patient is a smart man and describes himself as self-aware because he journals each night and is very intuned to his emotions. So he doesn't think this is due to any psychological issue and is 100% sure is something physiological with something structually wrong with his ears."}
