{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "(Verse 1) We were out in the bush, a long way from home In the middle of Australia, where the kangaroos roam Then we saw it in the distance, like a dream come true A gigantic red rock, yeah, we all knew (Chorus) It was Uluru! (Uluru!) Rock lobster! (Rock lobster!) (Verse 2) We came for adventure, with flynets on our heads Matching attire, looking stylish, it must be said With flies all around us, we had to be prepared In the Outback, you see, no one is spared (Chorus) Uluru! (Uluru!) Rock lobster! (Rock lobster!) (Bridge) Out here in the desert, the sun beats down hard But we were on a holiday, playing our cards Hiking and exploring, the stories we'd share Of a magical land, with its beauty so rare (Verse 3) Sunsets and sunrises, we couldn't believe our eyes The colors so vivid, like a painter's surprise We gathered 'round the campfire, under the starlit sky The memories we made, we'll never say goodbye (Chorus) To Uluru! (Uluru!) Rock lobster! (Rock lobster!) (Outro) Now our journey's over, but our hearts remain Forever in the middle of Australia's terrain We'll always remember, that rock so grand Uluru, the rock lobster, in this ancient land Uluru! (Uluru!) Rock lobster! (Rock lobster!)"}

(Oo-oo, Uluru!) Rock lobster! (Yeah, rock lobster!) (Verse 2) We came in a convoy, with flynets on our hair Colorful and quirky, we turned every head We danced and laughed, as the flies buzzed by Nothin' could stop us, not even the Aussie sky (Chorus) Uluru! (Hey now, Uluru!) Rock lobster! (Rock lobster, baby!) (Bridge) In the desert heat, we'd boogie down Twistin' and shoutin', no time to frown We'd hike and explore, with stories to tell In this surreal land, under a magic spell (Verse 3) We'd gather 'round the fire, singin' songs all night The stars our witness, in the pale moonlight Sunsets and sunrises, a kaleidoscope view Paintin' the sky, with every shade and hue (Chorus) Uluru! (Oh, Uluru!) Rock lobster! (It's a rock lobster!) (Outro) As we leave this place, our hearts feel light With memories of adventure, and the friends we hold tight Uluru, the rock lobster, we'll always remember In the heart of Australia, where the spirits whisper Uluru! (Uluru!) Rock lobster! (That's right, rock lobster!)"}
