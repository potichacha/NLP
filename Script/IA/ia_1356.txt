This input is appended to the existing content in a text box above, and then the sent to an API. The API response is then appended to the content in the large text box. This continues, with the user continuing to send commands which are appended to the existing text and the response from the API is also then appended. The app needs to remember the history of previous commands and responses. The user should be able to enter an API key into another text box, so that it can be used in the API request. It does not need to be save by the app, but instead is read from the text box each time.'}
