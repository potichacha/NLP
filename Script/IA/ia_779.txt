{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'This configuration is for an alert that monitors CPU usage on a system. Here\'s how it works: The alert uses a "DB LOOKUP" to retrieve data from a database. Specifically, it looks at the "system.cpu" chart and calculates the average of the sum of several CPU dimensions (user, system, softirq, irq, and guest) over the past 10 minutes (starting from 10 minutes ago and up to now), using the "unaligned" option. The alert has two "SEVERITY CONDITIONS" that determine when to trigger a warning or critical alert. These conditions use a formula that compares the current CPU usage to certain threshold values, which are different depending on the status of the alert (either WARNING or CRITICAL). The formula is: In summary, this alert is monitoring CPU usage on a system and will trigger a warning or critical alert if the usage exceeds certain threshold values, which are calculated based on the current status of the alert. The alert is checked every 60 seconds.'}
