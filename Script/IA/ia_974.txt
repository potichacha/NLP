{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Hávamál, or "The Words of the High One," is a collection of Old Norse poems from the Viking Age. It is found in the Poetic Edda, a medieval Icelandic manuscript. The Hávamál is attributed to the god Odin and consists of various maxims and proverbs on wisdom, morals, and advice for living. Unfortunately, the stanzas are not universally numbered, which can cause discrepancies in different translations. However, here\'s a version of stanzas 54-56 from the Hávamál, using the translation by Benjamin Thorpe: A foolish man, when among people, had best be silent; for no one knows that he knows nothing, unless he talks too much. He who previously knew nothing will still know nothing, talk he ever so much. A wise man, when he comes among the unwise, must be wary of speech. He often meets with ridicule when none can see the fault, which he only can see. A foolish man thinks all who laugh with him to be his friends; he knows not, when he sits with the wise, how they regard him. Please note that stanza numbering may vary in different translations. If these do not correspond to the stanzas you are looking for, please provide more context or specify the translation you are referring to.'}

However, I can provide you with a general idea of the content in stanzas 54-56 of the Hávamál. Keep in mind that these will not be the exact words from Jackson Crawford\'s translation, but they should convey a similar message: A foolish man should remain silent when he is among others. No one will know that he lacks knowledge unless he speaks too much. Even if he talks a lot, he won\'t gain wisdom if he knew nothing before. A wise person should be cautious when speaking among the unwise. Often, he will be ridiculed when no one else can see the fault that only he can perceive. A foolish person may believe that everyone who laughs with him is his friend. He doesn\'t realize how the wise perceive him when he sits among them. Please note that this is a general interpretation and not a direct quotation from Jackson Crawford\'s translation. If you\'re interested in reading his specific translation of the Hávamál, I recommend obtaining a copy of his book, "The Wanderer\'s Hávamál."'}
