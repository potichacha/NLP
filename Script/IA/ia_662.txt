However, when containing citric acid, such as Kirkland brand does (listed as "calcium citrate") the water should NOT be used without reliable Peach certification.'}

{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Why would citric acid be chametz'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Citric acid is not inherently chametz (leavened food made from wheat, barley, oats, rye, or spelt), but it may be derived from chametz sources such as corn, and can potentially come into contact with chametz during the manufacturing process. Additionally, some kosher certification agencies may have stricter guidelines for Passover, requiring certification even for products that are not inherently chametz, in order to ensure that no chametz or chametz derivatives are present. In general, during Passover, there are many additional restrictions on food and products beyond just avoiding chametz. For example, some ingredients or additives may be considered kitniyot, which are legumes or grains that are traditionally not eaten during Passover by Ashkenazi Jews. In order to ensure that a product is appropriate for use during Passover, it's important to look for reliable Passover certification."}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Corn is not chametz for Sephardic communities'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "You are correct. Chametz is defined as leavened food made from wheat, barley, oats, rye, or spelt. Corn, rice, and other grains are not considered chametz for Sephardic Jews and can be consumed during Passover. Therefore, citric acid derived from corn would not be considered chametz for Sephardic communities. However, it's still important to check with a reliable authority for any additional Passover restrictions that may apply in Sephardic tradition."}
