{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'I want to do TDD for a bowling game. We are developing in python and pytest. Complete Game A complete game consists of 10 frames. Requirement: Define a game, which consists of 10 frames. Recognize it as a complete game. Example: The sequence of frames (1, 5) (3, 6) (7, 2) (3, 6) (4, 4) (5, 3) (3, 3) (4, 5)(8, 1) (2, 6) represents a game. You will reuse this game from now on to represent different scenarios, modifying only a few frames each time. Can you do this for me?'}

You should also implement the necessary methods in the  Game  class to make these test cases pass."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "The content of the code file ( bowling.py ) should include the  Game  class with its methods. Here's an example implementation of the  Game  class that supports the test cases in the  test_bowling.py  file: Note that this implementation uses the following rules to calculate the score: This implementation should pass the test cases in  test_bowling.py . However, note that this is just one possible implementation of the  Game  class, and there may be other ways to calculate the score of a bowling game."}
