{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "John Kaercher, corporate lawyer supreme, Had a habit that caused quite a scene. During client meetings, while discussing the case, He couldn't resist his love for expired cottage cheese, with its pungent and tangy taste. As the papers were signed and the deals were made, John would sneak in a tub, carefully laid Beside his briefcase, hidden from sight, A secret indulgence that gave him delight. But one day, disaster struck with a vengeance, As John reached for his tub, with no hesitation. He didn't notice the expiration date, And as he dug in, his face turned to hate. The cheese was sour, and John's stomach churned, As the meeting went on, his face contorted and burned. The client noticed, and with a quizzical brow, Asked John if he was feeling okay now. John tried to play it cool, but it was too late, The damage was done, his appetite sate. He excused himself, feeling quite ill, And vowed to never again eat cheese that's past its fill. So if you see John Kaercher at a meeting with cheese, You'll know to beware, and offer him some peace. For though he may be a corporate lawyer of note, His love of expired cheese can no longer be wrote."}
