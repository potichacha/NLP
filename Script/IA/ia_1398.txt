{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'To stop your Mac from opening up Apple News when you click on an Apple News link in your browser, you can follow these steps: Open Safari (or the browser you\'re using) on your Mac. Click on "Safari" in the menu bar at the top of the screen. Select "Preferences" from the drop-down menu. Click on the "General" tab. Locate the "Open links from applications" section. From the drop-down menu next to "When you click a link in an app," select "In the current tab" or "In a new tab" instead of "In the News app." Close the Preferences window. Once you have changed this setting, clicking on an Apple News link in your browser should open the link in the same tab or a new tab, depending on your preference, rather than opening the link in the News app.'}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. To prevent the News app from opening when you click on an Apple News link in your browser, you can try the following steps: Open the News app on your Mac. Click on "News" in the menu bar at the top of the screen. Select "Preferences" from the drop-down menu. Click on the "General" tab. Under "Default Web Browser," select your preferred browser instead of "Safari." Close the Preferences window. By selecting your preferred browser instead of Safari, the News app should no longer open when you click on an Apple News link in your browser. If this doesn\'t work, you can try resetting your default web browser by following the steps below: Open the "System Preferences" app on your Mac. Click on "General." Next to "Default web browser," click on the current browser name and select a different browser from the drop-down menu. Close the "System Preferences" app. This should reset your default web browser and prevent the News app from opening when you click on an Apple News link in your browser.'}
