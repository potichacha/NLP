{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Yes, I can provide you with a solution to solve the go-acme lego challenge for Google Domains. Here are the steps you need to follow: Install the go-acme and lego packages using the following command: Create a file named "google_dns.go" and add the following code to it: Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values. Build the executable using the following command: Run the executable using the following command: This will obtain a new SSL/TLS certificate for your domain using the DNS-01 challenge and Google Cloud DNS as the DNS provider. I hope this helps you solve the go-acme lego challenge for Google Domains. Let me know if you have any further questions!'}
