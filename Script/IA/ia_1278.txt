{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'When working with the GPT-3.5 Turbo API, you may occasionally encounter text that exceeds the token limit. In such cases, you\'ll need to "chunk" the text into smaller pieces to fit within the limit. Here are some specific steps to follow: Determine the maximum token limit for the GPT-3.5 Turbo API. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, the maximum token limit for GPT-3 was 2048 tokens, but this may have changed since then. Check the documentation or API reference for the current limit. Split your text into chunks that are smaller than the maximum token limit. One way to do this is to split the text into sentences or paragraphs, depending on the structure of the text. You could also split the text into equal-sized chunks based on the number of tokens, although this may require more processing to ensure that the chunks are meaningful. For each chunk of text, make a separate API request to the GPT-3.5 Turbo API. You\'ll need to pass in the chunk of text as the "prompt" parameter in the API request. Depending on the programming language or tool you\'re using, you may need to adjust the syntax of the API request to include the prompt as a parameter. Collect the responses from each API request and concatenate them back together to form the final output. Depending on how you split the text in step 2, you may need to add additional processing to ensure that the chunks are combined in a meaningful way. For example, if you split the text by sentence, you may need to add a period or other punctuation mark between the chunks to ensure that the final output is grammatically correct. Depending on the context and application, you may also want to add additional processing steps to ensure that the chunks are coherent and consistent. For example, you could use a language model or other NLP tool to check for consistency across the chunks and adjust the output as needed. Overall, chunking text that exceeds the token limit of the GPT-3.5 Turbo API involves breaking the text into smaller pieces, making separate API requests for each chunk, and then combining the responses back together to form the final output. Depending on the complexity of the text and the application, you may need to add additional processing steps to ensure that the output is meaningful and coherent.'}
