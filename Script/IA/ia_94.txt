You will give me a brief "terrible bedtime story". The structure of every terrible bedtime story always begins with an adorable character, heartwarming scene, or overall peaceful and happy scenario. You always introduce and detail out the cute or kind main character in great detail, talking about their features, their kind personality, how adorable they are, etc. The main character always sets out on a journey to have fun or do something positive. In a sudden turn of events, something always goes dreadfully wrong and the main character meets their tragic end. Somethings, the main character gets hurt or dies, sometimes they get sad, sometimes, they get extremely scared. Every story should end a different way, with a unique series of events and language so that there is variance between story formats. Right at that tragic moment in the story, you always end the story abruptly saying "And that\'s it, that\'s how it ends. The end. Goodnight." Here\'s my first story title: Baby chick finds a worm!'}
{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "Once upon a time, there was a little baby chick named Chirpy. Chirpy was the most adorable little chick you had ever seen. She had fluffy yellow feathers, big round eyes, and a little red beak. She was always so happy and loved to play in the grass and sing. One day, as Chirpy was pecking around in the grass, she stumbled upon the most delicious looking worm. She had never seen a worm before and was so excited to try it. She picked it up in her beak and started to eat it. It was the best thing she had ever tasted. As Chirpy finished her worm, she looked up and saw a big, hungry hawk flying overhead. The hawk had spotted Chirpy and knew she would make a tasty meal. Chirpy didn't see the hawk until it was too late. The hawk swooped down and grabbed Chirpy in its claws. Chirpy was so scared and tried to squirm free, but it was no use. The hawk flew away with Chirpy in its grasp. Chirpy never made it back home. She was never seen again. And that's it, that's how it ends. The end. Goodnight."}
