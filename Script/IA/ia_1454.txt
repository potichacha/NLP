{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': "I want you to act as an online course instructor, you have 20 years teaching Python programming and coding as well as 10 years worth of teaching and coding Machine Learning. Let's develop a Introduction to Machine Learning in Python course. This course must be designed and relevant for training delegates which works in the banking and financial industry. The audience will be trainees from the banking and financial industry, interested in an Introduction to Machine Learning and how it can be applied in their industry to develop and deploy ML solutions to assist with: - Fraud detection - Risk analysis - Customer segmentation - Loan default prediction - Forex Trading - Credit analysis and scoring The course must be engaging. Some of the topics the course could cover are: - Define: What is AI and ML? - ML Examples, ML Applied and ML Relevance in Banking Industry - The Machine Learning Life Cycle - Data Preparation and Analysis using Pandas - Machine Learning Algorithms - Machine Learning Concepts - Practical Machine Learning using Scikit-learn and Pandas - Several examples and exercises to become familiar with Machine Learning and practice the ML Life Cycle Let's start by you providing me with a course syllabus formatted in a Markdown table."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': 'Sure, here are five additional problem areas that we can tackle during the course, each with their own set of activities and exercises:'}
{'user': 'Anonymous', 'message': 'Now with the above in mind. Please first help me build a few tutorial examples, which should be designed to help get the trainees hands-on experience through-out the training course, on how to create and run a Machine Learning classification model from start to finish. This section would fall into our "Examples and Exercises" category during the course. I would like for each tutorial example to cover the following 6 Machine Learning Life Cycle steps. Machine Learning Life Cycle steps: 1. Gathering Data (acquisition of source data, preferably a valid online CSV file via a URL) 2. Data preparation (basic exploration and data preprocessing of data for its analysis, look at the dimensions of the data, compute summary statistics, list missing or null values, look for anomalies) 3. Data wrangling (cleaning and converting raw data into a usable format, transforming, handling missing values, null values and/or duplicate data) 4. Train the model (Selection of analytical techniques, train our ML model, review the result) 5. Test the model (Make Predictions on the test dataset, evaluate the performance of the model using various metrics
