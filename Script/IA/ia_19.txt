{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "It's impossible for me to say whether 10 years is too long to wait to propose, as the decision to propose should be based on the individual circumstances and relationship of the couple. What's important is that the decision to propose is made when it feels right for both partners, and not based on any external factors or societal expectations. It's also important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your plans and feelings, and to make sure that you are both on the same page before making any big decisions."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "If you and your partner have been together since high school and she wants a ring on her finger, it's important to communicate openly and honestly about your plans and feelings. It's normal for couples to have different ideas and expectations about their relationship, and it's important to consider each other's perspectives and come to a decision that works for both of you. If your partner is eager to get engaged and you're not ready, it's important to explain your reasons and be understanding of her feelings. It may also be helpful to discuss what your future plans and goals are as a couple, and to come up with a plan that works for both of you."}

{'user': 'Chat GPT', 'message': "If you want to propose to your partner but don't want to talk about it because you want it to be a surprise, it's important to consider your partner's feelings and perspective. While surprises can be exciting and romantic, proposing without discussing it beforehand can also be stressful and overwhelming for your partner. It's important to make sure that your partner is ready and willing to accept a proposal before you make the decision to propose. If you're worried about ruining the surprise, you could try hinting at your plans or discussing the idea of getting engaged in a more general way. This can give you a sense of your partner's thoughts and feelings without giving away the surprise."}
