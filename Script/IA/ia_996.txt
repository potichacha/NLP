CSP provides a way to define what sources of content are allowed to be loaded by a browser, helping prevent XSS attacks. Here's how you can update your Nginx configuration to include a Content Security Policy: This example policy allows content to be loaded only from the same origin ( 'self' ) and disallows embedding the site in iframes ( frame-ancestors 'none' ). You may need to adjust the policy to include the necessary domains for your sp
